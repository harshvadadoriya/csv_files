1,B001GVISJM,A3IV7CL2C13K2U,Greg,5,Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me.
2,B001GVISJM,A1WO0KGLPR5PV6,mom2emma,5,"My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We've bought these many times from Amazon because we're government employees living overseas and can't get them in the country we are assigned to.  They've always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner."
3,B001GVISJM,AZOF9E17RGZH8,Tammy Anderson,5,"I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also.<br />There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM"">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>"
4,B001GVISJM,ARYVQL4N737A1,Charles Brown,5,I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn't dropped in all these years. Still a superb product you won't be disappointed with.
5,B001GVISJM,AJ613OLZZUG7V,Mare's,5,I love this candy.  After weight watchers I had to cut back but still have a craving for it.

When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM!<br />Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than I'm able to buy them right now."

9,B001GVISJM,AAAS38B98HMIK,Heather Dube,4,I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size.  I need them for my garage door opener.<br />Great deal for the price.
10,B002GWHC0G,A2EFAW1P3DRXWO,TJ Fairfax,5,"We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much."
11,B004N5KULM,A202WR509428VF,amateur amazon shopper,5,Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store's candy.
12,B004N5KULM,ASCNNAJU6SXF8,S. Beck,5,"It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more."

16,B004N5KULM,A7ZK2A3VIW7X9,Peggy,5,"This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy"
17,B001EO5TPM,A1E09XGZUR78C6,gary sturrock,1,Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!
18,B0019CW0HE,A2P6ACFZ8FTNVV,Melissa Benjamin,1,"I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it.  He wouldn't eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea.  We will not be buying this again.  It's also super expensive."

21,B004K2IHUO,AVCA516CFZ9HF,S. Fowler,4,"The crust on these tarts are perfect.  My husband loves these, but I'm not so crazy about them.  They are just too sour/tart for my taste.  I'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling.  My kids think they're great, so maybe it's just me."
22,B004K2IHUO,A1P21J0DMTVGS7,Lovethemovies,5,"These are absolutely scrumptuous!  My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship!  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are!"
23,B004K2IHUO,AL3E5V6MXO9B0,pionex1796,5,What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed.
24,B004K2IHUO,A2O9G2521O626G,Rachel Westendorf,5,I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!

26,B003VTN95K,A3KVJ2DVCLO0HB,Gadget girl,5,"I purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee ""tea"" bags.  They're great because they don't require refrigeration."
27,B007DJ0O9I,A24GM452AKJTT9,AMAZONGURL,1,"I received the items in a timely manner. Upon receipt, I removed a pack to consume. The pop-tart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth."
28,B007DJ0O9I,A328TUPI6HYZSF,Maplerise Mom,5,"I found these new spring Pop-Tarts and bought them on a whim.  My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun, colorful, amazingly detailed artwork on these Pop-Tarts.  Fantastic for after school snacks, lunch boxes, and school treats. Tie with a ribbon for a bright ""thinking of you this spring"" gift.  The only challenge is finding more in stores.  Way to go Kellogg's - fantastic product!"
29,B00469VSJI,A28D8FT2NNCS2Z,calledoutwithwords,5,"Yes, I am having a cup right now.  I went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee.  I paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money. Highly recommend."
30,B00469VSJI,A2EVOV2OZBQU53,Explorer777,1,"Taste like it is stale.  Will not order this again.  I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it.  This stuff tasted NOTHING, like the Douwe Egberts at the hall.  This is possibly stale coffee."
31,B00469VSJI,A1447CDAPZGLYV,SANA AWAR,1,"Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent. The product was not. Will not order again. Bad taste. Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes. I throw it right away, i coudl not drink it."
32,B002SRAU80,A156LLD3VZJGC2,D. W. Knowlington,5,"This is honestly THE BEST seasoning salt in all the land.  It tightens up any dish; not spicy, just perfectly seasoned.  It's perfect, hence, my purchase of this 35 oz. mamma jamma."
33,B0067LDV66,A1KZ67VEU7CJQ3,Bprice,5,"The order arrived as advertised. I have had only a few chances to use it, but it is awesome. The flavor is exactly what I hoped for! It may take me a while to finish the entire gallon, but I will definnantly order again!"

35,B000HKYP9A,A2CHZ5Q2EF3IR3,Mommy with an Opinion,5,"Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months, and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat.  I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat!  It's great because I didn't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."
36,B000HKYP9A,AD5WAUA14YD6N,M. Knapp,4,"I have a slightly different version of this - different brand.  My son started using it around six months, and he really enjoys it.  He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon, but whatever...  Anyway, I also had trouble cleaning it, until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush.  That works pretty well.  It takes some time, but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender, or cut it up, then clean it up off him, the chair, the floor, the dog, me, well you get the picture."

38,B000HKYP9A,A6VEEE9HOL004,"Jaime M ""Luc's Mom""",3,This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned.  I couldn't get the food pieces out to save my life. I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests.
39,B000HKYP9A,A3JBI5QDS32UEM,J. Foreman,5,"I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didn't want my new baby to choke on.  I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething. It worked great for this, as well as for the food. I didn't like bananas in it though-impossible to get clean!"
40,B000HKYP9A,AMNCDXFZKL6MZ,C. Lamberts,3,"I love, love, love the idea of this product and my little one loves, loves, loves to use it.  She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I don't have to worry about her choking.  The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out.  Granted, some foods are more difficult than others and some don't cause that much of a problem.  Bananas however, have pretty much destroyed a couple of them.  While I love this product, I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags."

43,B00067AD4U,A2OB1BFAEPAYBM,R. C. Wilkins,5,I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding. When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good. I literally had to hide the box to the wedding! They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables. It was a great tasting product for the lowest price I've seen!

48,B000SEJ84M,A19Y7MSOR2J7XP,G. Macleod,5,"I've purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix (which is a great product, by the way).  This is the highest price I've seen.  Whole Foods carries this item and it's been on sale there for $9.99 (that's Canadian dollars, too, as I'm in Canada).  It's even cheaper on Baker's Box's own website, and they're the company selling this product through Amazon. For a two-pack they should be charging $20 or less.  What gives?  I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices."
49,B001LMNXFA,ATBV3QRAVD2PJ,"Michelle L. West ""Paisleymll""",5,"The Sugar was sweet, that can not be denied.  As advertised, It didn't melt when baked either.  However, it will not do for your Liege Waffles/Gaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do.  These grains are smaller, think pretzel salt, or seed pearls."

51,B002J2DO8W,ASIAOU4JW8LUG,K. Gohokar,5,This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it.
52,B000U9V5AU,A2VOVLKP603R1T,D. J. Brown,5,"I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I'd original expected. (A common problem in some fruit wines.)<br /><br />This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).<br /><br />For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid."

I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and haven't found one yet, they're all so darned smooth. No bite, no after taste, a little pricy but still worth it. No worse price wise than starbucks or peets. Will keep running through the list here and see what happens. Love them all so far."
55,B0041QJSJS,A221AFCU6AE0QO,Sarah Bowman,5,"Having always been a strict Peet's Coffee lover, I was reticent to switch brands but Weaver's won my heart!! The taste is clean and strong, the ethos is correct (organic, baby) and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate. Be still my caffeinated heart!"
56,B0041QJSJS,A2BAVWMHL130WY,Bruce L. Ishimatsu,5,"Go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of Weaver's Peru Organic Whole Bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee.  And when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they don't know better, take along a travel mug filled with Weaver's coffee from home and enjoy a real Cup of Joe.  Er, Weaver's."
57,B0041QJSJS,A20B2BU1ZPY9AW,Mr Coffee,1,"A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and/or honey. Definately not my cup of coffee. Oh, did i say it was bitter?"

As a Peets Coffee fanatics we learned that Weavers roaster was the roaster for Peet's and we are hooked !  I already reviewd the French and Organic blend, but I must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink.<br />Met the weavers team at the Warner Brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast.

It invigorates like a puncture wound, and the only revival is that, after drinking, you discover that you are still alive.<br /><br />Well, one tea bag was enough for me.

I am a huge fan of Twinings teas, and was very excited to try this new blend.  After arriving home from the grocery, I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner.  Between sorting, washing, and chopping items, the hot water was added to the bag to steep.  Preparation continued, until a distinctly off odor hit me.  I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid!  I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea.  Even after cleaning up, and airing out the kitchen, my roommate later came in and asked about the smell.  Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product."

And the best chocolate in the United States is made in California, by the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. It is surely the best chocolate that one can find in so many stores, malls, etc. throughout the United States. Their actual stores are rare, but Kroger, Wal-Mart, Martin's (formerly Ukrops) and a long list of other grocery stores and many malls stock their products.<br /><br />I have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to surpass the quality of these. These are chocolates deserving of poetry. You can eat them quickly, or take your time and savor every moment of eating every one. The choice is up to you."

Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.<br />  The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares, and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste. Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth. Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regard.<br />  At the very least try the Ghiradelli."

It is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it! So it is basically just a cookie package! Yeah, that is really what I want to use as a travel mug. I agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store. The product description says the polka dot tumbler is ""definitely a keeper."" What? It is simply cheap packaging! Not something of quality to enjoy. Had I known that I would not have purchased the set. I really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis.

They can be used for what are commonly called ""jello shots,"" and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups."

I could not find these in any local store, so was happy to find them on-line.<br />Most people are unaware of them, so they are impressed when I serve them a little cordial or other liquor in a chocolate cup.  After sipping the<br />liquor, you can eat the cup.  What could be nicer?  Excellent product."

92,B004ET7MG8,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,"C. F. Hill ""CFH""",2,"Trident ""Strawberry Twist"" sugarless gum is very disappointing, both in taste and consistency. The strawberry flavor is very artificial tasting and, though I guess it is a good thing, not very long lasting. The gum also gets ""stringy"" fairly quickly.<br /><br />I chew a lot of gum, but will not be buying this flavor again.<br /><br />Not Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
93,B004ET7MG8,A33VG37SOTA0YS,Daxvieor,3,"Besides that mentioned in the title, the only other remarks I have about it is the price is hard to beat, the taste is akin to a Flintstone strawberry vitamin (for those of you that have tasted them), and taste lasts for not very long.  I'd say, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3.  Also, the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time."
94,B004ET7MG8,AI7W7S3IK45KV,"Young Professional ""Becca P""",5,I love this flavor and I cant find it on the shelves anymore. The gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when I used to buy it in stores!

OK it doesn't really taste like strawberry, but it's still delicious. It has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through, but then it gets tired, stuff, and squeaky.<br /><br />You'll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find, as I did, that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid. By obsessively chewing this product I filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25# in 3 months.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight."

When I brought her to NYC she had ear and eye discharge. She was also  slightly overweight. After a check up with a vet that ruled out infection, I decided to try Royal Canin based on the numerous good reviews.Within a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight. This is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her!"
98,B003AO5DLO,A228Q0U7S4D88X,Harley Quinn,5,"Our Spaniel has tried several foods in her 6 years, and this is the only one she will eat by itself without any ""people food"" being added (of course, we still treat her occasionally).  When we went in for our 12 month tooth-cleaning appointment, the vet told us to take her home as her teeth didn't need any cleaning for another 6 months, at least.  It is specially designed for their teeth and health needs, and she loves it.  And it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store!  What more could you ask?"
99,B003AO5DLO,A3BEO6VFOO8FRB,AggieSpaniel,5,"Royal Canin was recommended for my dog, but since this line of dog food is specific to breed, it was difficult to find in stores.  PetsMart and Petco carried the Cocker Spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio.  Finding a larger bag has been a great deal.  My cocker loves the food too!"

My dog loves this food and always finishes his food. I've used this for over 1 yr now & he has not tired of it. I have seen a significant change (for the better) in him, he's more active and doing well.<br /><br />I only buy this brand food for him now.<br /><br />Buster gives it 2 paws up & I give it 5 stars."
102,B003AO5DLO,A36D2ED3Q81YEQ,Atheenas,4,"I bought this for my one year old Cocker. However all the dogs love it. All their coats look better, they all shed less, eat less, use the bathroom less, my Cocker used to have this one chronic ear since the time I have had her as a puppy that it just gave her problems. It seems to have cleared up, no more smell. Her eyes give her less problems. And my 7yr old Yorkie he eats less, he used to throw up all the time had the most sensitive tummy. Our black lab mix, hot spots and she would just lick her fur off. All these great changes in a matter of a month.  I do mix it roughly 50/50 with Naturals dog food blend.  They are doing great.<br /><br />Sept 2012<br />I love this breed specific food, however I just went to place my next bi-monthly order and I am shocked at the price hike in just over a month!  I paid<br />$41.79 on Aug 3 for a 25lb bag and here it is Sept 20Th and the price has is now $53.94, a difference of $12.15 in price!  This is a huge amount to go up considering that I am assuming this is a price gouge; due to the speculation over crops :( I will look to my local vet for this product. I can get a large bag now less at Petco as well with the discounts they offer. They will order a larger bag if you ask."

111,B000IXUISS,A19YEVVAPRW51R,Craig Cook,1,"Cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured.  New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia, etc.  This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England, Australia or New Zealand Cadbury.  It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently.<br /><br />If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey version.<br /><br />Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA."

How I needed my fix!  A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned, and this Chinese Breakfast / Yunnan Black Tea set me straight.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said it tastes odd.  The flavor is strong and a bit smoky, like Darjeeling, only earthier.  Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey, it has enough flavor on its own -- no milk or sugar needed.  But it's expensive by the box of teabags.  Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic!  It arrived promptly, well-sealed, and true to the label -- unlike some ""loose"" tea that's actually cut up, this has the whole leaves that unfurl.  Ahhh."

This tea is my daily regular tea. Yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time. It's aromatic and flavorful without any additives. If you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than Earl Grey this Yunnan or a Keemun may be a nice option to explore."

I have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and I never get tired of it.  It's an excellent morning tea, is smooth without being insipid, and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping. Just use decent water.  I like a little stevia in it, as I'm a wimp. It brings out the natural sweetness of its malty, slightly floral style.  I just bought another two pounds."

I've been a caramel fan for ages, and while Werthers Butterscotch will do in a pinch, nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these.  They are chewy, buttery, and the little crunches of salt are spectacular (OK my mother didn't put salt in hers, this is an improvement)."

158,B003EM7J9Q,A1ZOIGQHW7FPT2,thorvald,1,"Giving the other 17 bags of these to the local food shelf just seems too cruel, better to throw them away.<br /><br />I don't know what good the 'popping' does except make them sort of hot. They're too salty, have a hideous flavor, taste nothing like pork rinds. They don't even taste as good as _bad_ pork rinds. They're also loaded with chemicals I want to avoid (probably part of the source of the hideous flavor)."
159,B003EM7J9Q,A97WE7CU7N0U3,"Bobbi D. ""Bobbi""",5,"These are so good, especially when they are still hot.  I love the way they still sizzle and pop while eating.  Sometimes I sprinkle some hot sauce on mine straight from the microwave or a little parmesan cheese, depending on my mood.  However I eat them, they are really good.  Remember to shake them well for a minute or two before nuking them.  The bags do not puff up as much as microwave popcorn, so don't expect them to.  Only cook for the suggested time on the bag."
160,B003EM7J9Q,A1FC0W6D6CDQ67,Cacti,5,"I have ordered about 6 boxes to date, I have only had a few times that they seemed salty, I think the shaking of the bag helps much on this. You also have to watch your own Microwave as to the time needed to cook, do not over cook them or they will burn and become hard. I like to dip in Vineger as well after cooking.(You hear the SNAP CRACKLE POP)Some like hot sauce on it too.<br />I found these in a food store the first time and I bought them as a joke, but after the first bag I was hooked! I'm glad Amazon has them because I can not find any local stores that sell them anymore.<br />I myself prefer the original flavor but this is more of a personal taste then anything else, many of my friends liked the Spicy. you have to love the warm Rinds."

Love these, they are addictive!"
163,B003EM7J9Q,A23GOCIWAOKQ9W,George E. Cavros,4,"If you enjoy pork rinds you are going to love this product. Hot and fresh pork rinds beat the socks off any of that bagged stuff from the grocery store that taste like steyrofoam packing peanuts. These little gems cook up light and crispy right from the microwave. They have a mildly spicy flavor that builds up as you make way through the serving but the heat never gets too powerful. The key to getting the best yield is to shake the bag before cooking. That will distribute the pellets evenly. Then you have to find the ""sweet spot"" for cooking time. Mine is 2 min 30 sec which leaves me with no burnt or uncooked pieces. I only have two minor criticisms: 1) The serving size is a little small and 2)the spice mixture is a tad bit too salty for me. Otherwise, these things are tops !"
164,B003EM7J9Q,A338DYDNUPBXWJ,Wild west farm,5,I am so glad we can get these from Amazon! Our family loves these microwave pork rinds and we can no longer get them from local grocery stores. If you like pork rinds you love these fresh popped ones.

166,B003EM7J9Q,A294XIDCE087BB,"Irreverent ""irreverent""",5,"I was delighted to be able to order these, since local stores no longer carry them.  The bags contain what appear to be chips of pork skin that were parboiled in salt water, then flattened under high pressure.  Be sure to shake them around to distribute them throughout the bag before cooking.  They expand considerably in the bag during 1:00 to 2:00 of nuking, depending on the wattage, etc., but it is a slow expansion, unlike the vigorous popping of corn.  Also, the bag  only expands about half as much as with popcorn.  When ready, these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep-fried, but these are far tastier, fresher, AND MUCH LOWER IN FAT AND CALORIES.  A whole bag is 210 calories, about 50 calories from fat.  This is less than the low-fat microwave popcorn I use.  One bag, however, has 50% of the daily salt limit for an adult.<br /><br />I especially like these sprinkled with garlic powder and dried marjoram (together).  Other herbs and spices are interesting variations, such as sage or cumin or whatever else might appeal to you."

I found these on a health food site and couldn't believe it, so I ordered a box.  They are really yummy and as long as you don't overindulge, you should enjoy them every time you are seeking something crunchy and salty (and low in carbs!)."
168,B003EM7J9Q,A33REC3J2JU2EL,D. Figueroa,5,"I do not like pre-cooked pork rinds, not even made fresh in the Mexican Carnecerias, but hubby likes them, so I decided to buy these.<br /><br />I was shocked to find that they were light, airy and crispy. Some bags were saltier than others, but we've cooked up about 5 so far and the majority aren't overly salty.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be. In our 1100 watt oven 40-43 seconds seems to be just right.<br /><br />The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy.<br /><br />Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs. I'm still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring.<br /><br />I wish they'd put out a version that didn't have seasoned salt as I'd like them with just salt and/or garlic."
169,B003EM7J9Q,A377IGU7KZH80L,Roy W. Latham,4,"These are an interesting and tasty alternative to microwave popcorn, well worth trying. The spicy version is not very spicy, but has a little kick. Be careful to even out the contents of the bag before microwaving and to make sure the bag rotates freely in microwaves with a turntable. Microwave time is short, about 90 seconds. They come out hot and fresh tasting. Pieces are relatively small, about an inch square. They have a less intense pork flavor than the best pork rinds, but having them hot helps compensate. Amazingly, pork rinds are becoming ""diet food."" They have no carbs, there is a lot of air in them that minimizes the calories for the volume, and relatively small quantities are satisfying. Anyway, it is a good story to go with a tasty snack."

JUST MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION AND SHAKE THE BAG WELL TO MOVE THEM AROUND.  YOU CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THEM IN THE STORE, SO IT'S GREAT THAT AMAZON CARRIES THEM ON THEIR SITE.

I live in New Jersey, so pork rinds are not that popular. I describe them to people as Funyuns texture with bacon flavor. They are very tasty, and calorie-wise, you get alot of bang for your buck.

So I popped a bag into the microwave and surprise!  The bag popped back!  It even puffed up like Orville Reddenbacher's best.  All that in less than 90 seconds.<br /><br />Turns out the little treats are bagged raw and freeze-dried and they actually cook and puff up in the microwave.  The difference between these guys and an off the shelf bag is the difference between bagged and freshly popped pop corn.  And since they're cooked without frying or oil they are -- dare we say -- healthy?  Well, maybe not raw carrots, but a third of a bag total out at 60 calories and 2 grams of fat.<br /><br />Not so guilty a pleasure after all."

You do have to carefully follow the directions on the bag.  This doesn't work the same as microwave popcorn.  The ""bake"" time is quite short, and overcooked pork rinds aren't pretty or tasty.  I think that in the future, if I want warm pork rinds, I'll try warming up a small batch of my usual brand in the toaster oven for a couple of minutes."
184,B003EM7J9Q,A34NVQTFD4QYJ0,Steve,2,I have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle. Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.<br /><br />I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.<br /><br />Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy. Just salty.
185,B003EM7J9Q,A3UQAI3GUDJVJY,Zentaki,2,"They're ok I guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it. You'll find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent. Also, no matter what you set the timer on the microwave, you will have little burn/hardened pieces. So you're not even getting a whole lot out of one bag."

I had the same issues with some of the others who've bought them in that finding out how long to microwave them with your particular microwave is a trial and error process on the first bag or two. On my first attempt, they ""fluffed-up"" fine, but I ended up microwaving them too long and some of them started to scorch (leaving a bad burnt smell, though not quite as bad as popcorn when the same thing happens). Spreading them out inside the bag before you start to microwave them is probably the single most important thing you can do. It's a little tricky, but you can get them to move around a bit with minimal effort. If you just throw the bag in the microwave as if it's popcorn, you won't get a quality product, but if you take the time to spread them out (as stated on the bag) and then watch the bag until it stops expanding (again, stated on the bag), they're quite good.<br /><br />Once you get the hang of it, the Bacon Curls are pretty delicious, especially paired with a beer or two (something pale and drinkable, from a ""yard work"" kind of beer to something like an IPA). The curls/rinds are light and fluffy, but very crunchy (surprisingly so, I was halfway expecting there to be some kind of greasy sogginess, but there isn't). They're on the salty side, but again, with the beer, that's a good thing. I like how they come out of the package sizzling and popping a bit, warm (not hot) and delicious. If you already like pork rinds, then this is almost a no brainer, as this is the same thing, only better (fresh, warm, delicious and with less fat)."

But fresh nuked pork rinds are a very different story.  These pigskins come out toasty and, dare I say it?  Delicious!  Significantly lighter and more airy than their grocery store counterparts.  ""They"" say you can use them to scoop up salsa or dip, but they're very good on their own, and I think the porky taste wouldn't go well with salsa anyway.  Maybe french onion dip - I'll have to try that.<br /><br />These pork rinds seemed fairly salty to me.

207,B003EM7J9Q,A2EPPPDY6L8T4B,Russ,5,"Great product, BUT!!!!! It's a little tricky to figure out the best time needed for YOUR microwave oven. Ours is pretty strong, and 1 minute 40 to 50 seconds is about right. However, BE WARNED! If you have an inexpensive or ""low power"" oven, the results will be very poor at best. (Just ask the crew where I work) When I tried to make a bag in the company cheap oven, it was SUPER slow to expand, and after the better part of 4 minutes, the burnt smell forced then to keep the door to the break room open for the rest of the afternoon! Bottom line....if you don't have a quality oven, don't buy these. One last word. After you remove the bag from the oven, carefully open, shake, and simply blow on them until they stop crackling. Otherwise they will seem stale until they cool. All this sounds like a pile of work, but after the first couple bags, you will NEVER buy pork rinds at the store again. I get a discount on the price because I have a box sent automatically every month. Works out to just under $13.00 a box with free shipping. Enjoy!"

They are quick to microwave, tasty and not terribly bad for you.<br />I first found them about 10 years ago on a local grocery store shelf. Soon after, they were gone from the stores for some reason. Found them on Amazon a few of years ago, and have been ordering them ever since. Always good.<br />Tip: Make sure you store them at a reasonable temperature. I let some get too warm in my luggage, and they sort of spoiled before I could micriwave them."

You have to be careful with the microwaving part, but even when you are, it's hard to get consistent results. They also could be a little spicier for my taste."
228,B003EM7J9Q,A3JJOPFZDOU2BA,712,4,"These pork skins have a great taste. Very fresh ""homemade"" taste. The cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though. I have a 1000w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag. The first bag I tried with 1 minute, and additional 15 second intervls, stopping at 1min, 15 seconds. Several skins had not yet cooked. So I rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. Still some did not fully ""explode"" or ""bloom"".  The second bag I started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. Slightly better results, but again I needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results.  The third bag I started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. Too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat.<br />My suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (They emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  As soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result.  This item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. To me anyway.  The jury is still out on whether the ""healthy"" claim can hold water.  I will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion.  Good Eats!"

I ordered a box of the Spicy and one of the Original.<br />They were here in no time.<br />We have a 1000 watt micro and we experimented a couple of times and found that 92 seconds was perfect for us. If we have a few that do not puff up (which rarely happens) you can put the few on a paper plate and put them back in the micro and it takes just a few seconds for them to puff up.<br />Because I am not a spicy food lover I wasn't as crazy about the Spicy as the Original but my husband loved them. So that made it possible for each of us to have a box of our own. Wahoo, I didn't have to share with him. Worked out great.<br />I would liked to have had a little less salt on them but was able to knock some off just by tapping the rind on the plate as I ate them.<br /><br />I would give this an excellent rating, in fact I am going to order 2 more boxes after I finish this."

242,B003EM7J9Q,AL00194S4EXWV,"Silverado ""jpfunk""",5,Great taste no carbs (I am diabetic) and low cal also. Only drawback may be sodium content. When you need a cracker for a dip I use them. I just make the dip from fat free sour cream and onion soup mix. The dip has more cal than the pork rinds. I n short they are a cracker substitute for me.<br /><br />Most complaints are  improper  cooking  results. Hate to say this but it is your microwave not the product. There are microwave ovens that have a real bad hot spot and this burns them. I had an oven like this (older model)and the problem went away with  the new  microwave.<br /><br />But the biggest thing in their favor is the taste. Love both kinds.

As far as flavors go, I prefer the ""Hot & Spicy""; it's a lot more interesting than ""Regular"".<br /><br />Suggestion:  Eat them while they're still warm, they're much better that way!"

256,B003EM7J9Q,AQP0NZQT7WCG8,T. M. Palmieri,1,"I normally rate whatever items I buy but rarely offer words of advice. Well, these things changed my mind. I love pork rinds. Usually I buy a tub of them from Sam's, but since I'm the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, ""Hey, that's the perfect solution!"". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.<br /><br />I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth. I'm still shuddering from it. If you like the taste of feet, go for it. If not, I'd suggest heading to Sam's to buy the wonderful tasting pork rinds we all know and love."

260,B003EM7J9Q,AFCUQ1C7R10YU,S. Martin,2,The taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed. Some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all. I bought a box of these so I tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes.

261,B003EM7J9Q,AVEMWTYR60X3W,benny,2,The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.

I thought that maybe it was a bad bag. I stayed away for a few weeks & decided to give them another try. BAD IDEA! They tasted like ammonia again! This wasn't caused by incorrect cooking time because they all came out looking puffy, and crispy. I ended up throwing the box out."
264,B003EM7J9Q,A3OLU8FL2S7L00,WDS,1,"A warning should be placed on the item description because this product contains Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), a dangerous excitotoxin which is problematic for many people. There is no indication in the item description that this is the case. I fully agree with another reviewer that this item also is so extremely salty that it cannot be consumed. The MSG also heightens the very salty taste. This item did puff up very nicely in the microwave, but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all 18 packages had to be thrown out. For that reason, I am surprised at the many excellent reviews of this product. Amazon.com gets an A+++ for their wonderful handling of this problem."

267,B003EM7J9Q,A3OXXYZ53AIAR2,A Bookaholic,4,"I was surprised at how well the rinds ""popped,"" and didn't have any difficulties as other reviewers did.  I made sure that I unfolded the package (it's folded into three just like a microwave popcorn pack), unbent the folds so that the product could move between the three areas, then I shook it vigorously several times, trying to distribute the contents somewhat evenly throughout the bag.  Two minutes in my microwave (1100 Watts, but 10 years old) is perfect, and virtually all rinds pop every time.<br /><br />This is a low fat product, so it isn't nearly as tasty as the supermarket pork rinds you may have tried.  One could easily eat an entire package, although there are three servings per bag, but you will pay the consequences in terms of salt intake and MSG overload.  The MSG triggered a migraine for me, so now I don't eat it frequently, and make sure I only consume half a bag at most.  When I get near the bottom of the bag, where the most salt and MSG ends up, I try to brush off as much as I can.<br /><br />Still, a good snack option for those with blood sugar sensitivities.  Zero carbs is always good! The only reason for my 4 star review is that the amount of MSG per bag seems to be pretty high, and that's not disclosed on the product's Amazon page."

The first bag seemed a little 'off' to me, but then I realized it was bacause they were not fried. After that I like them a lot. I think they could be 'hotter'. I found that you want to start at the low end of the cooking time and work up. For me about 3 bags was enough to figure out that 1:08 was the 'perfect' time for my microwave. Long enough that they all 'pop' but not so long that anything happens to the early 'poppers'.<br /><br />My daughter loves them also, and we are going through them at a pretty good clip. I'm going to put them on auto reorder when this batch is gone. They are perfect for evening snacking when the mood hits. Since you make them as you eat them, never a stale bag!

286,B003EM7J9Q,A3M07VHNUZYW83,"Cjg ""cjgnyc""",1,"After reading all the positive reviews, I was really looking forward to finally getting a very low carb (somewhat low calorie) snack that I can work into my low carb living.  I've had pork rinds from the stores and thought they were pretty good, so I expected this to be at or better than my local convenience store brand.  Wrong.  I was first disappointed with the texture.  After following the instructions to microwave from 1-2 minutes, some (about 1/4) were crispy, but the rest were almost like taffy and would stick to the teeth?  Perhaps I didn't cook long enough, so 2nd bag stayed in longer which made a few more crispy, but more burnt and chewy ones.  But texture is only 1/2 the problem, the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag. The taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste.  Finally,those without the full paper bag taste didn't really have a lot of flavor.  They were salty (which is to be expected),but that's really all the flavor you get.  So if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store (or can't find any in a near by store), this may work for you.  It  works out to about $1.00 a bag, so I'm not totally disappointed as my dog loves them.  By the way, my dog gives them 5 stars."

Upon returning to my desk I saw a bag of these on my desk that had been here for a few days; a gift from a friend.  I decided to take them to the microwave and give them a try.  I fully expected to ""pop"" them and open the door to the worst smell I could fathom.  Imagine my surprise when the bell dinged and I opened the door to the delicious smell of still sizzling savoriness that is Lowrey's How n Spicy Bacon Curls.  It was like cherubim descended from heaven and placed God's favorite snack in my mouth.  I was bathed in a pillar of light and from nowhere the volume rose to a crescendo of Beethoven's 9th Symphony.

If I have a complaint, it's that they are a bit salty.

Since then, the only way to find them had been to order them streight from the manufacturer, until now. I'd had mixed results with the microwave process. I'd had many bags just burn without popping. Recently...just for fun, I thought I'd see what would happen if I tried lower wattage. It worked!! Now I use my 900 watt microwave vs the 1100 watt microvave I'd initially used."

People on a low carb diet can eat any kind--but if you are watching your fat intake, these are an excellent alternative.

I like both the Hot and Spicy and the Plain Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds, but like the Hot and Spicy best.  I found the perfect time in my microwave of 1:20, but had to experiment to find the right amount of time.  Before taking them out of the plastic I shake them a little.  Once in a while they will fly out of the bag when I try to shake it when the bag is out of the plastic and opened flat like the directions show.  You really need to get them dispersed in the bag before popping if you want full big puffy pork rinds, which I think needs to be done more than 5-6 times like the directions state.  Some bags do seem fuller than others, however.  I have to agree these do stink when taken out of the microwave.  I turn my stove fan on before taking them out of the microwave and pour them out of the bag under the fan and hold the bag and bowl up to the fan for a few seconds.<br />I've tried dipping these into ranch dressing which is a bit of a treat too, but seems to make the porky too soggy, but I like the taste of it."

To give you a better idea of what I'm referring to, Kettle Chips Sea Salt variety have 55 mg of salt per 1/2 oz of chips. Lowrey's pork rinds have 310 mg of sodium per 1/2 oz serving. That's roughly six times the salt content of a food considered relatively salty by most people.

They're light and crispy if they're popped correctly, a little on the salty side because of the MSG seasoning (beware migraine sufferers).

358,B0061JW7I2,A3U6MBLMVTR6I2,James,5,"I have enjoyed nong shim's flavorful ramyun offerings for 10 years now.  I only recently saw their Black label product and hesitantly indulged as it was $2 a pack.  worth it for me.  I think i like it a little better than their classic ""gourmet spicy"" and am now subscribing for a case every 6 months.  It has beef and beef bone flavorings, perhaps an acquired taste, but they are well executed for an instant product.  It's less piquant than the ""gourmet spicy"" classic flavor, but very rich in taste thanks to the beef bone extract and other seasonings.  If you like nong shim's gourmet spicy, you'll probably like this.  I like pork bone ramen (Tonkotsu) and really like this as it has the same milky richness in the broth.  I am excited that it's relatively lower sodium (920mg per serving=half pack) than most similar products and apparently has no added MSG... with so much flavor they apparently don't MSG or so much salt.<br /><br />*edit- to other folks that prefer gourmet spicy... i agree that is a classic but enjoyed these more: very good broth especially, less heat but more rich flavor than gourmet spicy.  the lack of sumptuous hunks of freeze dried beef doesn't bother me, I'll garnish mine with whatever I have in the fridge.  I'm disappointed amazon has raised the price somewhat, a case was about $10 cheaper in december.  If you're hesitant, try a single pack at your local korean grocer before you get a case."
359,B0061JW7I2,A35ZBKDM15G8ZR,luckyanh,4,"so i am pretty accustomed to the regular nong shim red and was slightly taken a back by the 'pricier' deluxe black label.  my friend told me to try, and since i take her word- i gave it a whirl.i had it last night, and was quite pleased. both  my boyfriend and i ate the entire thing.  it was nice and creamy (not clam chowder thick, but not basic boring broth either).  the ONLY reason why it's not 5 stars is because it was a TAD too spicy, but not unbearable.  i will be getting more, and saving these for special occasions ;)<br /><br />p.s. there were 2 ""soup base"" packages in it, so im wondering if the red one is an extra spicy pouch. ill try it without the red one...maybe."
360,B0061JW7I2,A7EZQK97FIE35,"E. Wenck ""Spicy food is best food.""",3,I have been a long time fan of the Nong Shim brand of noodles.  I started eating them back when I could only get them in all Korean packaging at different local imported grocers.  Being able to buy them with more frequency online is a very nice thing.  I had waited for this specific noodle to be released here and ordered it as soon as it was available on Amazon.  While the hype was high and I do love most Nong Shim products this is good but not great.  I do like the additional packet of seasoning and the different vegetables in this bag.  It might be good if you find the subtle differences worth the premium but I would rather have about twice the regular Shin Noodle at less price.  I do like the differences but I do not believe the premium is justified on this particular flavor.

It's a sort of hot and spicy beef flavor.<br /><br />The original spicy picante is better and more reasonably priced.  This is not worth the extra cost.<br /><br />My two top faves are Shin Ramyun Gourmet Spicy Picante and Sapporo Chow Mein.  Throw some fresh or frozen spinach in and you've got yourself a nice quick, semi-healthy meal.  The Sapporo Chow Mein doesn't have near the sodium the Ramyun does."

365,B0061JW7I2,AEMT81Q5C2JCD,K. Looper,5,"This is my favorite ramyun! Having lived in Korea, I've tried lots. For most kinds, SPICY is the dominant flavor, but this one has a dominant BEEF flavor plus spice and garlic. It's rich. I love it.<br /><br />I like to keep control of my sodium, so I don't use the entire pack, and I barely notice a difference in taste since this is so rich. I put the leftover spices in a mini container and after a few times there's enough to flavor something else (like a cheap bag of noodles or some veggies).<br /><br />Personally, I think this ramyun is well worth the price. For flavor as well as being MSG-free. With the subscription, I pay $1.63 per pack. I can't get great ramyun locally at that price. And I'm happy to have the huge case delivered to my door."

I have more than a dozen different types of noodles stocked in my pantry & I love trying new ones too. I've a subscription to 30 packets of Nong Shim's Gourmet Spicy noodles & was expecting this to be much better. Really, the taste is great. Same type of noodles, texture, etc..same spicy flavor packet but there is another packet of soup seasoning included. There's no dried vegetables packet like the Gourmet Spicy flavor has. No dried vegetables flakes & no beef chunks like the description stated, thus false marketing. The price is too much for this. If this is the new & improved Gourmet Spicy noodles, I'd give it 4 stars. I took off 2 stars because of the unworthy price tag & another star because of the false marketing. I read a comment reply in another review here - A Korean reviewer... I agree entirely. Big hype & price tag but disappoints. I'll stick to the Gourmet Spicy if I were you. Worth the try but not 24 packets!<br /><br />Edit: Not false marketing since it seems like only the very first packet had no dried beef & vegetable so I changed the rating to a 3 star. However, the beef ""chunks"" are just flakes. Not enough flakes to notice. There are also dried mushrooms. Now, the mushroom pieces are bigger than the ones in the Spicy Gourmet vegetable sachet. Still, not impressed. 1/29/2012"

Other reviewers have said the same so it wasn't just a bad batch I received. They just don't put any discernable meat in this product.<br />Sorry Nong Shim but I needed to give an honest review."

I do not like the taste of the tea without sweetner -- it is very bitter even when using a lower temp for the water (because its green tea) and this is the first time I've ever tasted a green tea that I didn't care for -- The Two Leaves and a Bud Jasmine Green is divine!  With sweetener, the Orange Sencha Green is tolerable (for me).  What I like about this green tea is its medicinal effects.  On the back of all Two Leaves & A Bud packages are brief statements listing what types of foods the teas pair with and/or what the tea is ""best for.""  The Orange Sencha Green Tea states that it is best for concentration ... and it is.  If I'm feeling particulary foggy headed or out of sorts (lol), I drink a mug of Orange Sencha Green and it clears my head right up!  I appreciate teas that have effective medicinal qualities that are evident within a few sips and this makes up for the unpleasant (my opinion) taste.  I will continue to purchase it and would recommend it as a good reading or studying tea."
371,B000FH2Y1G,A1KED9UTGDZHSW,Alpha Centauri,1,"For anyone who is a seasoned Sencha tea drinker, this is tea is a total dud.  It barely tastes anything like fresh, high quality Sencha nor even older dried sencha leaves.  I had to throw this in the trash because it's simply dreadful."
372,B000FH2Y1G,A26YJ4GM1XGNZN,LD ODOM,5,"I only thought I knew what Green Tea was supposed to taste like before trying this awesome product. My local grocery store was clearing it out (much to my benefit). Once I experienced it, I drove back the very next morning and bought the remaining inventory they had to enjoy and share with friends. Several months later after running out, I went to the company's website in Aspen Colorado and ordered some more.<br /><br />When I ran out again, they were kind enough to inform me that I could order it from Amazon and that it would qualify for Amazon's awesome free shipping. What an amazing deal. Thanks to everyone at Two Leaves and a Bud and Amazon for their insight to carry such a great product.<br /><br />Bt the way... This is ""Whole Leaf Green Tea"" and the tea bags are adorable sachets versus the paper type you get with everyone else. Top drawer stuff. You actually savor every last drop."
373,B000FH2Y1G,AGU6VZYYI1E0J,libra103chic,5,"I debated a little about whether or not to order just because the reviews are so split down the middle. But I'm a big fan of other Two Leaves and a Bud varieties so I decided I had to give it a fair try. I'm glad I did! I prepared it with warm water, just the same as I do with all green tea, and it turned out really nicely. It's got a light smooth flavor & just a hint of orange. With just a little bit of stevia, it was perfect. I am not a sencha aficionado, so I cannot make a thorough comparison to other sencha teas. But I have been drinking a variety of green teas for a long time and can definitely say it stacks up to the other nice greens that I've had. It's also really refreshing iced so I recommend giving it a try that way this summer as well!"

So far this one, and Celestial Seasonings Raspberry are the only two I can stand. I have tried Zhena's green teas, and other brands, but I like this one best. I add a teensy bit (1/4 teaspoon) of Organic Agave for sweetening, and I'm good to go. The bags are elegant, and I love the orange aroma of this tea. I also enjoy Two Buds Earl Grey and their Assam (with almond milk, yum). I wish that other reviewer who disliked this flavor would send me his/her box of 100! I'll drink it. Maybe if you're a purist Green Tea person, this one is too flavored; but like I said, my uneducated palate loves it."

378,B000FH2Y1G,A1B4ROPSIENCIK,P. Colbert,3,"This is great sencha tea with just a hint of orange.  Being whole leaves rather than just the fines really makes a flavor difference - almost as good as brewing from bulk leaves and certainly more convenient.  It's too bad it's packaged in what appear to be nylon bags, however.  They do not seem to be readily decomposable - not a good thing since we try to compost and recycle everything we can."
379,B000FH2Y1G,A3KPT4FF3J91W4,"Keith Shepard ""Who cut the cheese?""",1,"Well, where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have been drinking tea (green, black, oolong, white, etc.) for more than 15 years as either loose leaf (whole leaf) or bagged. My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and ""deep""). I have also tried many of the products offered by ""Two Leaves and a Bud"" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).<br /><br />This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).<br /><br />The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).<br /><br />Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & ""bitty"" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.<br /><br />I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM"">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.<br /><br />Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.<br /><br />My advice: buy a single box of this first. If you like it, switch to coffee."

Al-muftah ""naturally""",4,"the tea was of high quality and came in biodegradable pouches that looked like silk bags, but I had two problems with it, first the orange taste was barely detectable, and the silk-like bags worried me because they did not state the material of the bags or how it might react to the heat of water that I would end up drinking, non the less these bags gave me a sense of luxury"
381,B00080QKT2,A24NN70EK8XFZH,Ryan,5,"Honestly, this is the best green tea I have tried so far.  I have tried many different brands of tea bags, and some other loose leaf teas.

Ayer reading the reviews I went for the Tea Attic organic gunpowder green. The price is comparable to other brands online and locally. I had good communication from the seller, and was given two sample teas to try as well (both were fantastic)<br /><br />The tea was packaged in a brown bag. It smelled great, was tightly rolled, and had a fairly shiny surface. I immediately re packed it into a metal tin and it has stayed fresh. When steeped, the pellets expand perfectly revealing the full leaves. It is wonderful to watch.<br /><br />My only complaint, which I know is subjective, is that the taste is much more bitter than I expected. I know how to brew tea and other green teas brewed the same way are not as aggressive. In general, I am not shy about earthy teas, but this was too bitter to drink strait. I added some honey, but could not tone it down enough. I resorted to mixing it In small quantities with other teas to add body and use it up.<br /><br />I gave this tea three stars because the seller was great, and maybe my taste buds are more sensitive than yours.

391,B0046GWNCW,A4D04FOF07XW4,"J. Alphin ""pobayou""",4,"Guayaki organic yerba mate' was the first organic mate' I ever purchased. The flagship label in the Guayaki line is their traditional ""yellow"" organic label, which is ok but has about 25% stems, seeds, and whole leaves. I like this San Mateo Guayaki organic ""green"" label better. It is, at least to my taste, a fuller flavor than the standard Guayaki. As of 5/28/11, it is substantially cheaper than the standard Guayaki label. The San Mateo label also seems to show less yerba stems and seeds. The reason I deducted one star is the presence of (even still) too many stems and seeds as well as the uncompetitive price. Guayaki badly needs to filter their Yerba leaves in their existing products or offer a different label with pure, refined leaf. Other yerba mate' vendors offer this and it is a gaping hole in Guayaki's product line. Even though this product is more affordable than the rest of the Guayaki yerba mate' line, it is still very expensive compared to other organic and traditional yerba mate' labels from other companies. An adjustment to competitive pricing as well as attention to filtering the yerba leaves would give this product 5 stars."
392,B0046GWNCW,A2O35GAUNQ9MH,J. Cordova,4,"The ""San Mateo"" blend of Guayaki's loose leaf yerba mate is lighter -- less harsh -- than their more readily available ""Traditional"" blend.  I can drink either blend but much prefer San Mateo because it clearly dried without smoke (they do not say whether the traditional blend is or not) and has a more ""refreshing"" flavor to my palate.  Long time drinkers of more traditional blends available in South America (Argentina, Uraguay, etc.) may not like it and may even find it bland or undrinkable, but from my limited experience with other types of yerba mate and my more ""American"" (United States) taste combined with the fact that I do not smoke (I have tried, but never liked it) I can barely stomach the more aged ""smoked"" or ""roasted"" types of mate.  If you feel the same way there is a good chance you'll like the San Mateo blend."

I bought them because I have a sweet tooth and wanted some cookies and these were on sale plus I had a coupon.  I purchased the crispy cookies, the vanilla sandwich cookies and the chocolate sandwich cookies.  I thought they were all very good and would not hesitate to buy them again. I found these cookies to taste very good, similar to a chipsahoy but a little crispier.  Now they do have splenda in them as the last ingredient, not sure why because I think they would have tasted fine without it, but you can't even taste it.  At least I couldn't.

It's not amazing in flavor or tenderness but it's very edible and still delicious. This doesn't have a real salty flavor some brands do and it doesn't have a very smoky flavor either. It's good to see a little bag of mid-priced jerky. Most jerky here is $4.50-$9 a package.<br /><br />My favorite jerky that's the most tender and has the best taste is made by a company in Sonoma, California called Krave Jerky.

Would have given 4 stars, but one of of boxes had a tiny tear and was leaking powder. Used it anyway. Also, a couple of weeks later, found the same product for $1.50 at Winco (on sale, probably), but driving that far to Winco isn't convenient, and after paying tax and gas, perhaps the savings isn't that much unless you buy a lot.

Baker ""cbaker""",5,"The label on  Frank's Hot Sauce says ""The Perfect Blend of Flavor and Heat"" and I must say this is an accurate description of the product.<br /><br />Frank's Hot Sauce is outstanding.  It's a Cheyenne Pepper based hot sauce that is not too hot, not too sweet, but has just a perfect blend of ""flavor and heat.""  It's not like Tobasco sauce which is very hot and you sprinkle on items.  It's a different kind of sauce (I love Tobasco).  Frank's is a hot sauce you can use more liberally to your liking because, while it's hot, it's not so hot you can't really dig into it and enjoy the rich flavor and spices.<br /><br />I like to use this sauce to dip chicken tenders in, but you can also use it too cook buffalo wings, put it on eggs, French fries, burgers, whatever you like.<br /><br />This size really is way too small to purchase.  If you like hot sauce you will be done with this size bottle in no time and kick yourself for not buying a larger, more economical size.<br /><br />I highly recommend this hot sauce."

It is good in Mexican dishes, soups, bean soup, Buffalo wings, baked beans, and many other foods.  I like to even add it into barbeque sauce to spice it up and grill out using the mix as a basting sauce.  Sometimes I even mix it up into other sauces to make a hotter taste and you can really jazz up your cooking.<br /><br />I added a photo of the nutrition label for your help.  There is a good recipe for Buffalo chicken wings on the bottle.  You should note that one teaspoon of this sauce does contain 8% of your daily allotment of salt.<br /><br />This is a good hot sauce and it is one of many that I enjoy."

454,B001FCLL0U,A2JA2RLQXBWMCY,S.L.,5,"So, there is a bit of confusion here about the ingredients in this product. Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a ""spice flavor not found in nature,"" they claim, so I guess there's no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I'd rather have the natural version since it's natural and I like that one anyway.<br /><br /> As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth. So that helps a lot, but apparently it has 3 calories per serving.<br /><br />If you like this, you may also enjoy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LDS"">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>--another spicy herbal tisane that I like without sugar.

It's mildly curried, with coconut and rice, and it actually tastes like something like something an adult would eat.  It's just enough texture for little ones to handle too.

I am not sure if it is a texture thing as he also doesn't like hummus (lentils and chickpeas are maybe a similar texture), but he loves the Peach Pumpkin Pie flavor as well as tolerates the Black Beans and Corn. These are the only 3 we have tried.  I would recommend not getting a whole case unless you know your baby likes it.  I have to say that of the three this was my least favorite (I try everything my son eats).  My personal favorite is the peach pumpkin pie though.  It tastes like Thanksgiving but it is very healthy!

He then switched her to Iams, and now on the rare occasion she has those problems, the carpet isn't stained like it was before.  Iams is a little more expensive than other brands, but it's definitely worth it.  Your cat doesn't cost that much money to keep anyway, so you might as well feed them better quality food.<br /><br />I defintely recommend buying this product from Amazon (the pack of 8 2-lb. bags).  You pay more up front, but it averages out to about the same, or maybe even a little less, as buying the 4 pound bags from the local stores.

517,B000E63LOM,AXAJXJZUL2J5P,D. Scott,5,"This is an unexpectedly enjoyable tea.  The mate gives it a deeper and woodier taste than black tea alone, with just a hint of smokiness.  While that might not sound particularly appetizing, it's actually quite good.  However, I ONLY like it with a squirt of lemon juice (and sweetener).  Without lemon juice, I don't enjoy it, but I have to have lemon juice in my plain tea, as well.<br /><br />The flavor is distinctive enough that when I moved to a small town where the local store doesn't carry Morning Thunder, I didn't switch back to plain tea.  I had to start getting multiple boxes on my periodic trips to the big city.  I was delighted to find that Amazon now offers it at a price lower than most supermarkets.  Having it delivered (for free with Prime membership or Super Saver) is the ultimate in convenience.<br /><br />I don't find this tea particularly invigorating (not that I notice, anyway, which is perhaps a good thing), but the mate does seem to live up to its reputation as an appetite suppressant.  Whether it revs you up or not, it's a great way to get started in the morning.  And with the astonishingly high level of antioxidants (due both to the tea and the mate), you can actually feel good about drinking it.<br /><br />Don't be alarmed by the six-pack size.  It's a good enough tea that you'll go through it quickly.  Each box is individually wrapped in plastic (as you'd get it at the store), so you can expect a long shelf life."

I tried various teas and coffee substitutes with limited success.  When I found mate, I knew I was half-way there because I liked the energy, but I longed for stronger taste.  Hence, when I found Morning Thunder, with half mate and half black tea, I rejoiced.  A steaming cup of this, graced with soy milk, is truly a gift from God.  Enjoy!"
519,B000E63LOM,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,#NAME?,5,"Morning Thunder is an excellent name for this drink, but I have a feeling it might put some people off, as the tea is very good without being too whacky and crazy tasting. I was expecting a real potent punch, but upon reading that it had yerba mate in it, which I  drank in one of my favorite Chai mixes, I was sure it would be palate pleasing and I was right! This tea is very simple, as the ingredients list is short; roasted mate and black tea- no fillers, no funny stuff and no funky herbs and spices.  Upon further search on the internet of it I found out that Yerba Mate is an herb that is traditionally prepared as an energizing tea and consumed by natives of South American countries as it contains high concentrations of antioxidant flavonoids possessing potent free radical quenching activity.  It also includes several B vitamins, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Beta-Carotene and Calcium. Mixed with black tea, the Mate tastes like dark chocolate, just a hint mixed with the tea, it's a subtle yet an eye opening experience upon the first sip.<br /><br />I try to take good care of my health and drink lots of tea and water, but I had no idea how high in antioxidants this tea was! Per serving it had 1150mg, compared to 375 to 800 in broccoli, 600 to 900 in Tomato Juice and 650 to 1100 in Orange Juice. Tea is much easier to prepare than eating a bowl full of broccoli and drinking tomato juice, and it's quite refreshing and also tasted nice with some milk and sugar. I don't add lemon to it, just sugar and I let it soak in for about 3 minutes. Its makes a slightly smoky, chocolaty and exotic brew, yet it's still tea can be drank at breakfast or tea time. I love the cover art and the simple goodness of Celestial Seasonings, as it reaches out and transforms many coffee addicts to tea lovers &#61514;<br /><br />- Kasia S."

The feeling was similar to a regular caffeine lift from coffee, but it also created a feeling of mental alertness rather than jittery.<br /><br />BUT ---  there is some evidence that consuming too much of this in certain ways can cause health problems.<br /><br />I'm not trying to be a ""downer"" or rain on anyone's parade -- enjoy it if you choose. I do believe, however, that there is nothing wrong with informing people and then letting them make their choices. The studies done seem to be legitimate. The odds are against any one of you readers being harmed by yerba mate, but out of thousands of drinkers, there will likely be some who are. So this is just in the spirit of helping you make an informed decision, especially if you smoke.  And I wasn't biased against it -- I REALLY did enjoy it.........<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />You can look up other studies if you choose, and disregard the ones that you believe are not convincing.

I take a few bags with me to work for a quick caffeine fix in the middle of the afternoon that way I have a fresh cup and dont have to brew an entire pot of coffee for just a cup or two.

Morning Thunder, with its surrealistic depiction of bison, is a perfect depiction of this powerful tea. Yerba mate is a stimulant from South America, mainly consumed in Argentina. Celestial Seasonings roasts it, giving it a somewhat burnt flavor.

For me, there aren't any side effects other than being more awake.<br /><br />The flavor is very herby and grassy.  It reminds me a little of the Asian grass jelly drink.  It's not something that I would order at a restaurant, but the flavor is passable for me so I don't mind drinking it.<br /><br />The leaves come in fancy pouches that don't have a string attached.  I've found that I can either let it sit for a while to get stronger or I can stir it to speed up the process.  I don't know if tea aficionados would object to stirring it, but I suspect that tea aficionados would be buying loose leaf tea anyways.<br /><br />Overall, I find it to be a great replacement for coffee or any other caffeinated drink.  It definitely wakes me up and I don't get any of the side effects of drinking coffee like bad breath, the jitters or an upset stomach."

I like my black tea strong and hearty and this is my favorite.  Just a wee bit stronger than Irish Breakfast IMO and with a great flavor.  I am a bit picky when it comes to teas and coffees but had to give this one an A+++ for every catagory.  You won't be disappointed.  Also, you can actually find this on most grocery store shelves compared to some other brands and the price is compariable to others."

Not only is it dignifying to say, ""I'm drinking my cup of Morning Thunder"" and have the rest of your office envy you, it's fun to say, tasty to drink, and delicious to even just let it steep while you drink.<br /><br />Cheers to you Celestial Seasonings, you've done it again.

I can't imagine a morning without it.<br /><br />ANYWAYS - so I was pumped to be able to order it on Amazon since my local Giant stopped carrying it.  However, I was disappointed when I realized that one of the 6 boxes of tea in there was Peppermint and not actually Morning Thunder.  At this point I had already opened one of the boxes so I couldn't return it (plus it would have been a pain) - but nonetheless pretty annoying.  Peppermint tea is not what I asked for."
539,B000E63LOM,A29313797NGT9L,Eddie Wannabee,4,"Morning Thunder Tea is the kind of tea with a kick. I do not know about anyone else but to me strong tea makes me feel pretty darn good, almost like I am getting away with something (funny, since its perfectly legal..) and perks me up on my branch and all of a sudden I want to do things and stop dozing off. I want to create, to ponder on issues otherwise reserved for the acute minded, I want to get so high from that tea that I might start laughing for no valid reason, make a fool of myself. Can anyone tell I am on it right now? I am as happy as a clam. Once I drink it early in the morning and I am a little moody for thinking I did not sleep well and I am Bitchy and un-accessible to the world the Morning Thunder takes care of setting my course straight. I am sure there are many strong teas and by God, I would like to meet them all, but Morning Thunder is under my roof so it gets 4 Stars for being there, help to accentuate the self for the productive side of things. Long Live America!"

It brews to the color of a medium or medium - dark roast (closer to medium).  It is bright without being overly acidic (it retains a smoothness, but not so smooth as to be mellow; it is still bright).  It is rich and good mouth feel.  It retains it's flavor for the whole pot without changing (I'm assuming it would if you left it in glass carafe on hot plate).<br />I brought a thermal carafe to work right after brewing and honestly, it could have been a coffee commercial:<br />Eyes opening widely, ""Omg, this is really good coffee.""<br />Big grin, ""This is delicious!

I liked them all.  The peanut butter chocolate chip was the most ""desserty"" flavor of the bunch with a few chocolate chips in the bar.  The Cherries and Berries had some nice dried fruit chunks in it and a nutty sesame taste.  The Granola with Coconut tasted exactly as the name implies.  I will likely purchase the variety pack again instead of the single flavor boxes.  They do not have a lot of protein and are somewhat high in fat, are very moist and chewy, so they aren't what I am used to from my meal replacement bars (I really like Zone Perfect Fudge Graham bars - my kids also like them which is a bonus and a decent after school/before sports snack that transports easily in backpacks and sports bags).  Nice for a change but not quite as filling as others I have tried."

I have tried so many different brands of jerky and have not really found a good substitute to that old brand until a month or so ago I found THIS brand in a small grocery store in the middle of nowhere U.S.A. and bought it on a whim.  I couldn't contain myself because I had FINALLY found a substitute to that old brand, and I just had to get more of it and fast.  So I came online to find it and Amazon.com had it so I ordered a WHOLE case.  It got here in great time and was packaged very well.  I now have a standing order to receive this product every so often and am loving snack time again.<br /><br />This is not the kind of Jerky that makes you feel like you just ripped a hunk of meat off a dead cow, it's been ground up and processed and then made into strips, but that's the kind I LOVE.

Some was tender and fresh, while some was too stale or smoky-tasting and would get left unfinished.  The expiration dates were at least 6 months ahead, so that wasn't the problem.<br /><br />Anyway, we recently ordered the bags and were pleasantly surprised.  They're not quite as tender and tasty as the first canisters we opened years ago, but they're worth the price.  The only problem we've had is that out of 6 shipments and 72 bags, 4 bags contained mold -- from 3 different shipments.  Three bags had just a couple spots of mold but were a little stale and tasted funny.  The fourth bag had about half the surface area of the jerky covered in white mold, and the smell was pretty bad.  We're still eating more but checking for mold first -- not something we should have to do.<br /><br />As someone else mentioned, the Amazon's product photo and nutrition information are old.  The bag now advertises 16 grams of protein, not 21.  Fat content is increased from 10 g to 14."

I was tired & grossed out when feeding them & having them lick any of us, so now I feel better. I know they are getting the nutrition they need & they can be veg along with us. They adore the food too & don't seem to be missing meat, if they were I would let them have some, but I would buy some organic, better farmed stuff to feed them in that case, not dog food in a can. Meat in a can has so much junk in it, it's not really meat anymore or healthy."

The added white tea really adds a delicious note to the cup.  As these bags are stringless/tagless, they work well in my ekobrew cups used with Kuerig machines.  I like to use two bags, though, to get a full-bodied flavor.  Even using two bags, it's still a fraction of the cost of the k-cups."

607,B000E63LOW,A1EJ95I5W5S8FK,That Chatty Gal,5,"I adore this Celestial Seasonings Decaffeinated Green Tea! Before this, I had been drinking Stash Premium Green (with caffeine).  I had heard bad things about the taste of decaf teas in general so I was hesitant to try this decaf version from C.S. But, WOW, am I glad I did. This tea has so much more flavor, is so much more delicate and lovely than Stash could ever hope to be. And this is decaf! Remember when you brew green tea - it is best to use water that isn't quite hot enough to boil - that keeps your cup of green tea from getting bitter. (Conversely, black and herbal teas are best made boiling water) Also, do not brew it too long - meaning, don't go longer than the recommended time noted in the box flap - or you'll release more tannins and experience slight bitterness. Personally, I brew mine on the weak side (3 minutes) with not quite boiling water, I add 1/2 tsp of sugar, and milk .... pure heaven in a cup. Lovely fragrance, taste, and aftertaste. Others might say milk overpowers green tea, but I enjoy it. I believe this tea only contains 5 mg of caffeine per cup (decaf is never 100% free of caffeine) so you may drink it at night without worry about staying up all night, or if you doc recommends cutting down on caffeine, or if you simply want to give your tummy a break from irritating caffeine - this is the ticket.

617,B000FJLXHU,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,buru buru piggu,5,"Kokuho Rose is a variety of medium-grained rice developed and grown in California by Koda Farms. It is very similar to Japanese rice (japonica), which is short-grained and fat. Introduced to the American market in 1963, it is well-suited for Japanese cuisine because it's very sticky and glutinous, having the same taste and texture as Japanese rice. It is a very popular choice for making sushi because it is relatively easy to find and inexpensive.<br /><br />To make sushi rice, the kernels have to be washed until the water is clear, then steamed. I use an electric rice cooker like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009E3F68"">Panasonic SRG06FG 3-Cup Automatic Rice Cooker</a>, but you can get fancier ones that cost upwards of $100. Cooked perfectly, the grains are firm, slightly elastic and have a shiny, pearl-like luster.<br /><br />You should be able to find this at your local Asian supermarket, as it is a widely distributed brand. Some bigger American supermarkets may also carry it. Another popular brand is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HQKHUI"">Nishiki Premium Rice</a>. These are the two major brands I use and recommend. If you can't find either of these, a third brand is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MCHN8Q"">Botan Rice</a>."
618,B000FJLXHU,A3R6YKLCA0L5N0,minette,5,I've tasted different rice varieties and this one is incomparable in taste and texture. Some of you may be skeptical but this special variety is short and plump but has a nice shine and not brittle when it is steamed. Also the texture is smooth as you eat it along with your favorite foods. Excellent for sushi. People who like their cooked rice a bit glutinuous will love this.
619,B000FJLXHU,A2VVX8QLABUKRG,jennmommi,5,"This was recommended on a Sushi making site and I can see why. The difference in the Sushi from last time to this time was tremendous, and the only difference was the rice that I used."
620,B000FJLXHU,A3Q7LQU2LLQZWW,CarsonWoman,5,"This rice is a nice change from the traditional white rice I find in the local grocery, primarily because it's sticky. When reheated it tastes as good as it did when first prepared. I find that both white and brown rice becomes hard after sitting in the fridge overnight and I end up throwing the leftovers away, but this rice is simply not the same. It still seems freshly cooked 3 days later."
621,B000FJLXHU,AZ5B28A6W0YG9,E. Baxley,5,I live in Japan (for now) and this is the rice that always sells out the most at our local store and I have to buy it in 20lb bags for my house but the price on here is high. But it is worth it.
622,B000FJLXHU,A3UY55IAD3KJJF,a Chihuahua Owner,5,This is great rice - I cook this in my rice cooker ALL the time to go with my chicken curry.  BUT.....$13 is WAY overpriced.  You can get this in most local grocery stores (like Giant and Shoppers) for less than $7 for a 5lb bag.
623,B000FJLXHU,A51N43JW681E,Jessie,1,"I tried this brand along with about 5 others while on a recent sushi making kick.  This rice was significantly inferior to several brands of other California grown sticky rice, as well actual sticky rice from Japan.  Rice came out more mushy than other brands - almost like it was overcooked, and on several occasions I would find a few hard pieces of rice mixed in with the rest.  It's passable, but definitely not preferred, especially if you are trying to make sushi or something else where rice texture is important. At the time of this review the price is $14.95 for a 5 lb bag, compared to $7.20 for the same bag at my local Japanese supermarket - the review grade does not reflect this price differential, recognizing that it could change.  I should point out however, that at $15 for a 5 lb bag, you can buy premium sticky rice imported from Japan in a decent Japanese supermarket.<br /><br />Update: Have added additional brands to my comparison list, this one really is on the bottom by far, I question whether the 5 star reviewers have tried any other options (just about any California short grain variety, Botan Calrose from the supermarket, Nishiki - all significantly better than this.)"
624,B000FJLXHU,AOINAOO0NQRGN,Rooster Eberle,5,"I'm quite the novice when it comes to rice, so I'm not going to deliver any lectures on the genetic and cultural history of sticky white rice. I just know that I like the sticky rice that I've gotten from the better Chinese take-out restaurants. I also know that the precooked rice packages I was preparing at home were too expensive and not that good. And it also seemed like a good time to stop eating too many potatoes.<br /><br />So I bought a bag of this rice, a bestselling Aroma rice cooker, and a good rice washing bowl. My selections weren't based on expertise. I just went with things at the top of Amazon's bestseller lists that were in an economical price range. I carefully rinsed enough rice for a dinner party of four, threw it all in the cooker, pushed two buttons, and checked it an hour later.<br /><br />Boy, was I ever amazed. This product produced the best sticky white rice I've had from anywhere--home cooking, take-out, restaurants. It has that nice glutinous quality that allows the rice clump to together in some of the most favorable mouthfuls I have ever had so far as white rice. This stuff is really a keeper. At the rate I'm going through  it, one bag might last 5-6 weeks. And that's for just one person.<br /><br />I guess this rice is good for sushi. I wouldn't know. I just like to load it on a plate, use some salt, crushed peppercorns, and soy sauce, and put something else (like an entree) off to the side. The rice is so good by itself, the entree is almost incidental.<br /><br />So I expect to be buying more very soon and highly recommend this. I also recommend the Aroma cookers, which are quite the bargain right now."
625,B000FJLXHU,AVASUHV0NLOFQ,"Mark Blaine ""The Other Guy""",5,"I bought a bag of this and a steamer from Amazon earlier this week and received both today.  I have to say, I didn't think it was possible but I have just made some of the best rice I have ever had.  It may be expensive and I may be inexperienced in the world of sushi rice prices but as of right now I say this stuff is worth every freaking penny.  It fluffed up and is sticky sticky sticky.  Awesome."
626,B000FJLXHU,ACXNTBNYX7652,G. Butler,5,"Pretty clean rice, doesn't need much washing as compared to the cheap stuff I got at an asian market down the street.  Cooks up nice, tastes good.  Doesn't have any dark stuff that floats up during washing (or cooking, heave forbid!).  Wish I could buy a 50 pound bag of the stuff for a bulk discount."
627,B000FJLXHU,A1Q9CRXICY363I,H. Lett,5,"I love Kokuho Rose rice and have been eating it since the early 80's. The only problem has been finding it in something other than 10 lb. bags. The 5 lb. bag is the perfect size and the rice itself is great eating, and you can eat this rice all by itself, no topping/flavoring necessary."
628,B000FJLXHU,A1MHDPOOJM5W7N,"bordercrosser ""bordercrosser""",5,"I'd never tried this rice before, despite seeing it around forever and hearing good things about it. Finally picked up a bag when we ran out of our Lundberg Akitakomachi rice (good stuff -- try it), and was pleasantly surprised. I did rinse it several times until the water ran clear, and brought the cooking water up to just about my first finger joint. Brought it to a boil, then covered and let simmer for 15 minutes, then shut the heat and let it steam for about 20 minutes more.<br /><br />It has a very pleasant gloss and stickiness, along with a subtle, clean flavor. It's perfect for sushi, but I'll also use it alongside other Asian meals, since it's very chopstick-friendly. Our staple is usually Golden Phoenix Thai Jasmine, which is exceptional -- if you're lucky enough to find it, don't miss it; but I'll definitely start adding this rice into the rotation. The texture is quite delightful and a nice change of pace. If you enjoy moist, stickier rices for general eating as well as sushi, you'll find a lot of ways to use Kokuho Rose. But shop around, as the listed price is quite high for the amount of rice.<br /><br />I also picked up a bag of the same producer's sweet/glutinous rice, specifically to use for homemade rice wine. I was surprised to find it too bland for eating, but it worked just fine for the wine."
629,B000FJLXHU,A17CGVLWCXFGXG,G. Shepard,5,"This is a great rice, tender when cooked and sticky. But this $18.00 price for 5 lbs is way too expensive. I bought a 20 lb bag for 22.50 at the local Asian Market. Look around your town for a far more reasonable price."
630,B000FJLXHU,A3L1EEUPFTPUBQ,K. Bodey,4,"I was glad to find a 5 lb. bag of this rice.  It's wonderful.  I also found it at my local Costco at a much cheaper price per pound, but you have to buy the entire 25 pound bag, which is not practical for an individual!  Very good!"
631,B000FJLXHU,AC8A7XTCUCEIZ,in pain,4,"I was pleased with the product's taste and texture, but it didn't make great BMs for me (made them a bit sticky without getting to graphic). I tend to have a sensitive system. I have switched to brown rice because that makes my innards feel better and the BMs better, but it is harder to make sushi with brown rice."

635,B0051BWU92,A2GZG363BPADYC,Larry Deemer,5,"*********************************************************<br /> UPDATE:  READ THE UPDATE BELOW FIRST. Thanks. (June 15 and August 3, 2012)<br />*********************************************************<br />  I WAS, BUT NO MORE (actively anyway). We have four cats: two (""normals"") who eat about anything, one with kidney disease (CRF/CKD) and accompanying reduced appetite, and one that has picky (and weird) tastes.  In the process of trying to find an appetite stimulant for the mom-cat (with CRF/CKD) I tried out several products on her and the others (the kids) as well.<br />Here are the results of this less than scientific (or definitive) survey:<br /><br />  Drs.Foster&Smith Shrimp Snappies Treats (ground to powder)-----------ALL REFUSED.<br />  Freeze-dried powders (Prowl and Ziwi Peak)----------------------------NO EFFECT. All but one (Ms. Picky) ate them.<br />  Seafood juices (tuna, oyster, sardine, etc.)-----------------------------NO EFFECT. All but (same) one ate them.<br />  Dry (ground to powder) cat food (Halo, EVO, Blue Fuffalo, etc.)---------NO EFFECT. Ditto acceptance.<br />  Canned cat food (gourmet brands & renal diets)------------------------Ditto.<br />  Hairball tube lubes (usual suspects & Cat Grass)------------------------Ditto.<br />  Mark&Chappells De Furr-ums treats------------------------------------Ditto.<br />  Calming chews & liquid (Pet Naturals)----------------------------------Ditto (except Ms. Picky accepted)<br />  Brewer's yeast(powder)-----------------------------------------------Dulled all appetites a bit; all accepted<br />  Barley Cat (GreenFoods; powder)--------------------------------------EFFECTIVE on mom-cat; others liked except...<br />Drs.Foster&Smith Tuna Treats (ground to powder)----------------------EFFECTIVE on mom-cat;  all others liked<br />  Bonito Sprinkles (Cat-Man-Doo)----------------------------------------EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE; ditto<br />  8in1 Dingo Anchovy Fillets (ground to powder)--------------------------Ditto (effect & acceptance)<br />  Tropical Fish Food (Sergeants Atlantis)---------------------------------Ditto (except Ms Picky liked; 2 normals NOT)<br />  Purina Whisker Lickins Tender Moments (Chicken flavor)-----------------BEST (effect & acceptance)<br />  Whiskas Temptations Treats (crumbled by hand)------------------------BEST (effect & acceptance)<br /><br />Most of the products were accepted by most of our cats but their appetites were not helped noticeably until I found the last seven: Barley Cat (separate review), Drs.F&S Tuna Treats, Cat-Man-Doo Bonito Sprinkles (reviewed here), 8in1 Dingo Anchovy Fillets, tropical fish food (I did not test the ""regular"" or ""beta"" but ingredients were similar and loaded with fillers and dyes; no reason to suspect that the brand is critical), Purina Whisker Lickins Tender Moments and Whiskas Temptations Treats (only ""regular"" Salmon and Chicken flavors tested). Only the Whiskas  Temptations were effective to the point of bringing all our cats' appetites back to the ""relish"" or ""enthusiastic"" stage. None of the products were ""perfect"": most lacking in some degree of effectiveness or acceptance and the regular Whiskas Temptations (?the ""natural"" versions?) lacking in quality ingredients and difficult to crush by hand. I have avoided brands like Whiskas for years on nutritional and ethical grounds but I will reluctantly use them in a flavor enchancer role until I find a more suitable alternative. Three of our four cats had weird responses to the tropical fish flakes: our two ""normals"" were absolutely repulsed and our Ms Picky licked her bowl clean.  Go figure.<br /><br />The Cat-Man-Doo (CMD) ""sprinkles"" I bought from HealthyPets.com for just a bit less than the price on Amazon. These are the only dehydrated bonito in ""sprinkles"" form (there is a TUNA DASH product out there but more expensive) that I could find. Other bonito products typically are  large flakes and more expensive. Although the CMD product comes in a shaker jar it is not a ""sprinkles""  form like salt or pepper and does not shake out as easily or evenly; the ""sprinkles"" are still flakes, just a lot smaller. If you decide to further reduce the size of any of the products it is not necessary to pulverize them to a fine powder.  Generally they come out of a shaker container a little more uniformly if left slightly course. The Whiskas  treats, because of their soft center, are best crumbled by hand.  The Whiskas  products present the best value: about 300 servings for about $1.80 on sale at PetCo (and a bit less at Walmart). Purina Whisker Lickens come in several flavor varieties and, though equally effective, contain about 150 servings and are more expensive even on Amazons best terms (multi-pack and free shipping). Purina WL (3 oz) would have to sell for under $1 per pack off the shelf or with free shipping to be competitive. I found several of the products (DrsF&S, 8in1, Sergeants, Purina WL, and Whiskas) at a discount store (BigLots). Among the dried fish products, the CMD sprinkles do offer good value: about $2.80 per ounce (before shipping, taxes) and provide so many servings that I could not attempt to count or even estimate. If your pet gets turned on by CMD then, because of the prodigious number of servings, the CMD could be the better value. A word of caution on the CMD quantity: The listings and ads stated that the sprinkles jar contains 8 oz. NOT TRUE.  The company used a fluid ounce (volume) measure rather than a weight measure for this particular product.  The sprinkles jar contains at least 2 1/2 oz by weight. Even so, the price still beats other brands of bonito (and tuna) products that I ran across.  Credit to the company, however, since they packed the jar about as full as possible and they responded positively to my complaint about the choice of measures and confirmed that the labels, ads, and other marketing materials will be changed ASAP to state the 2 1/2 oz weight measure. Will they pack the jar as tight?  Cat-Man-Doo also is introducing a chicken sprinkles product (2 oz size).  I wonder: would our Ms. Picky take to that?<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Effective appetite enhancers are out there and probably one that matches the pickiest/weirdest of tastes.  The problem, as I discovered, is finding it.  As far as I can tell, there is no logic, no rhyme, no reason to use as a guide. Individual differences among cats seems to be the norm and consistency of preferences does not appear to be of any evolutionary value. Cases in point: our Ms. Picky.  She does not like flavors OF meat and fish  but loved the food flakes FOR fish; our ""normals"", who rarely refuse anything, were sorely offended by the same offering.  Personally, we now have reasonably priced go-to flavor enhancers for all our cats (Whiskas Temptations) and  back ups (Cat-Man-Doo Sprinkles) for all as well, even Ms Picky.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I powdered and combined the 8in1 Dingo anchovy product and the Cat-Man-Doo sprinkles, which suggests that other closely effective products may be mixed successfully. I did it just to use down the anchovies since they are relatively expensive and I probably would not purchase them at full retail price.<br /><br />So until their tastes change (again) we are no longer actively searching for appetite boosters.  Hope this review helps (with products or ideas) ANYONE ELSE (even dog companions) WHO IS STILL SEARCHING FOR A PET APPETITE ENHANCER.<br /><br />  ****************************<br /><br />UPDATE: AND THEIR TASTES DID CHANGE--REPEATEDLY. AND I ACQUIRED A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE after trying over four dozen flavor additives over the past year. There are two approaches to re-stimulating pet appetites; ON food or IN the pet; that is, from the outside in or the inside out. I WAS TAKING THE WRONG APPROACH, assuming that all I had to do was find the right product to add to my cats' food and Valla!, problem solved! The following are my personal conclusions after many months and conversations with several vets:<br />  1) Diminished appetite may be difficult to distinguish from strong preferences (picky-picky) and preference changes.<br />  2) Normally healthy pets experience swings in appetite (like, seasonal or during hairball buildup) and do not need extra appetite stimulants or treats (although you would never guess that from the explosion of treats on pet food aisles). Even pets that play or perform only expect approval, attention and affection. Everyday pet feed should provide an adequate level of sensory interest.  If not, then find an appropriate formula (or mix of brands and wet/dry) that does. Affordability may be an issue but ""treats"" are not cheap and I have not done the math to get a fix on the  pricepoint at which treats would become more expensive. In any event, off-the-shelf enhancers/treats may have a role in case of genetic or age-related sensory loss, as a short-term aid, as a palliative after a rough experience/day, or as a ""last resort"".<br />  3) Pets with known or suspected medical issues may need the inside-out approach. Additive appetite enhancers may not be much help if the reduction in appetite is due to a medical case. The short term benefit from (even the best) appetite additives (anywhere from one meal to several months), may be long enough to keep them going while the underlying medical issues and related appetite symptoms are resolved (or not). Some inside-out Rx appetite enhancers also may only work short-term (maybe up to 6 weeks); others may work if administered continually; the best (but not typical) outcome would be a jumpstart of the pet's natural appetite.<br />  4) Pets on a special diet (like calorie restriction or Rx) have fewer choices of feed and MAY benefit from added (outside-in) appetite enhancers to even the most palatable available special diet formulas. Expect short term results and anticipate having to cycle through various enhancer products frequently.<br />  5) One reason for the loss of ""magic"" of appetite enhancers is pet intelligence:  they may eventually figure out that they can ""cherry pick"" the tasty additive and leave the relatively unappetizing food; or ""wait out"" your first offering in anticipation of tastier follow-up offerings. BUT the flavor additives work better as sprinkles and tend to lose their magic if mixed in with the food.  I found this to be the case even if I ""marianated"" their regular food with the flavor enhancer in water prior to meals.<br />  6) I have used the phrases ""flavor enhancer"" and ""appetite stimulant"" interchangeably. There probably is a substantive difference but my interest was the end result (a hearty interest in meals and increased consumption).<br /><br />For those readers who are interested in further lists of products I have tried, I set out the items I have researched/used since the last report. They are organized a little differently, hopefully in a more useful fashion.  Besides the specific items, you may find the list helpful in generating further ideas to experiment with.  Unless noted otherwise, the off-the -shelf products were crumbled or pulverized if not already in powder form. Prior consultation with your vet would be advisable if not required, for the INSIDE-OUT types and may prove helpful  before venturing even into the realm of off-the-shelf and DIY flavor enhancers.<br /><br />THE INSIDE-OUT TYPES  (do not depend on the senses but work internally, if at all, to stimulate appetite):<br /><br />  Vitamin B-12 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Dexamethasone (Rx injectable steriod)<br />  Pro-biotics ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Depo-Medrol (Rx injectable anti-inflammatory )<br />  Pre-biotics ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Mirtazipine  (Rx anti-depressant pills)<br />  Exercise ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Cyproheptadine (Rx anti-histamine/serotonin pills and  compounded liquid)<br />  Charcoal (medical/food grades) ^^^^ Cerenia (Rx anti-nausia/inflammatory pill)<br />  Pepcid AC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Zantac<br />  Oral Electrolytes (Non-Rx fluids like: Pedialyte, Caravet, Ions, Pets&Vets, and DIY recipes)<br />  Rx injectable Electrolytes (""Sub-Q"" fluids)<br />  Rx Oral Electrolytes (like: Rebound OES)<br /><br />THE OUTSIDE-IN TYPES  (depend mainly on the senses of smell/taste to get the attention of the appetite):<br /><br />  Hills Science Diet AD (Rx) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Pet Vitamins  (Sargeants)<br />  Dental gel ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Liver (raw, sauteed; chicken & beef)<br />  Garmon VetClassics Cranberry chews (crumbled)^^^^Liver (human-grade dessicated/dehydrated; capsules/powdered)<br />  Cranberry (liquid)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Hairball ""treats""<br />  Beefeaters Cod (freeze dried puffs)^^^^^^^^^^^Milk<br />  Cat Milk (Whiskas) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Chicken (freeze dried puffs)<br />  Clinicare RF ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Canned pet food (regular & Rx; seared/browned; crumbled)<br />  Lactulose (Foster & Smith)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Boutique canned food (like Fancy Feast)<br />  Spirulina (St. Jon Naturals)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Vienna Sausage(chicken; meat & broth)<br />  Vita Gravy ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Pet Naturals Calming Chews, tabs, liquid<br />  Friskies Crispies ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Mars Crave treats<br />  Pounce treats ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^JRBFoods Catty Shack treats (Walmart)<br />  ""Super"" Reds/Greens (human) powder ^^^^^^^^^^Bench & Field treats<br />  Other petmates dry food (powdered) ^^^^^^^^^^Foster&Smith Joint Care 2 (powder)<br />  Catnip (powdered)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^8in1 Kookamunga Catnip Spray<br />  Catsure liquid diet^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Rebound Liquid Diet<br />  Cheerios breakfast cereal (crumbled) ^^^^^^^^^^KMR (liquid)<br />  Vanilla extract (no alcohol)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Pet Greens (freeze-dried liver puffs)<br />  Natural Balance Platefulls-sardines (pureed) ^^^^^^My Little Lion (salmon)<br />  Natural Balance Perfect Bites (rabbit)^^^^^^^^^^ EVO Wild Cravings<br />  VetsBest Right Bites Health Management (dogs) ^^^Mixins (Variety Pet Foods)<br />  PureBites (Pure Treats Inc)freeze-dried liver puffs ^^<br /><br />MOST/LEAST EFFECTIVE Rx PRODUCTS:  There are differences; but best sorted out between you and your vet.<br /><br />MOST EFFECTIVE OF THE NON-Rx PRODUCTS:<br /><br />  In addition to the better ones (according to our cats) noted in the original list (Barley Cat thru Whiskas Temptations), add these to the BEST class::<br /><br />  Dessicated/dehydrated Liver (human grade) capsules/powder (go easy, may cause the runs)<br />  Seared/browned Canned Pet Food (regular and Rx)<br />  Vienna Sausage (chicked meat & broth)<br />  Catty Shack treats (crumbled)<br />  Natural Balance Platefulls-sardines<br />  Pet Greens Freeze Dried puffs (liver)<br />  Natural Balance Perfect Bites (rabbit)<br />  My Little Lion (salmon)<br />  EVO Wild Cravings (herring & Salmon)<br />  VetsBest Right Bites Health Management (dogs)<br />  Mixins (Variety Pet Foods)<br /><br />LEAST EFFECTIVE NON-Rx PRODUCTS:<br /><br />  In addition to the originally listed ineffective ones (again by unscientific poll of our cats): F&S Shrimp Snappies thru brewers yeast powder, add these:<br /><br />  Vita Gravy (Petsmart)<br />  Bench & Field treats (Trader Joes)<br /><br />ALL OTHER NON-Rx PRODUCTS<br /><br />  Most were accepted by all four cats but were not particularly effective as appetite stimulants in our trials. Your pets, especially the healthy ones, may respond more favorably.<br /><br />  IF I WERE STARTING OVER WHAT WOULD I DO?  (Supplementing my ""perspective"" points above) HERE ARE MY MAIN TIPS:  1) Get to know my pets' taste preferences in advance of any need  2) Check for medical causes  3) If no medical issues, switch to the other form (dry/wet) of the pet's regular food and try as a flavor enhancer topping and/or as a substitute  4) Then try  warming or browning the wet version of the pet's regular food  5) next, your best choice of a ""treat"" or supplement with the pet's favorite flavor used as a topping  6) then one with a liver taste, such as Barley Cat or Pet Greens Freeze Dried  7) Then Cat-Man-Do bonito sprinkles, Natural Balance Platefuls, Catty Shack treats, Purina Whisker Lickins, or Whiskas Temptations 8) If a product meets with initial acceptance, withhold judgment on ""effectiveness"" until after a few meals worth of experiences  9) forego trying all the hundreds of ""treats"" in search of ""the"" one that will work after you have gone thru your best shots  10) If there are medical issues, consider off-the-shelf and Rx appetite stimulants, singly or in combination  11) If a liquid meal substitute is called for consider REBOUND and CLINICARE RF, but also CATSURE and KMR and (as a last resort?) human versions of liquid renal failure products. Acceptance at this point will likely be a major issue but at least they are there for the trying.<br /><br />  My apologies for the awkward columns but I could not figure out a neat way to compress the information. Hope all this helps and Good Luck."
636,B000EH4XZC,AYFNND2XCUXF1,K. Montgomery,5,"Sure, you've got to have some patience if making even a simple risotto with little ingredients, but it's the cooking time, the prep and then stirring, for about thirty minutes or so, that makes this so. If you're a rice lover though, and you've never tried making this creamy dish, you must give it a try! Not only is it easy to make, but it's one of those dishes that you can put on the table, roll out the impressive name it comes with (I just love the way risotto sounds when spoken) and you've got an impressive and tasty presentation for guests or even your family.<br /><br />It can be as simple as the great recipe on the box, which Amazon lists in the label description above, or you can fancy it up with some great grilled chicken or shrimp and crispy (or steamed if you prefer) veggies. I would recommend using a good wine, one you'd likely drink with your meal, since this only adds to the amazing flavor (cooking wines DO NOT do the trick!). Experiment with the recipe on the package if you want. Parmasan cheese is a great additive at the very end, it's rich pungent smell coalescing with the other flavors excellently, but don't be afraid to try some others,. i.e. fontina, asiago--heck, even some cheddars work great! When those short grains start to release their starches, the creaminess comes into play and you're almost ready to eat! The smells are devine and it's a dish you will not be able to resist. RiceSelect's risotto rice works great every time, making for the perfect risotto experience."
637,B000EH4XZC,ACSMY3AG68GVZ,"Cassandra Alvarez ""alloy321""",5,"Ever since first seeing Risotto being prepared on a Gordon Ramsay program, my boyfriend and I couldn't wait to try to make it ourselves.  Finding the correct rice (arborio) was difficult enough, and after trying the brands from 2 or 3 different stores, we decided RiceSelect made for the best Risotto.  We used to buy it at SuperTarget before finding it here on Amazon.<br /><br />Our basic recipe:<br /><br />Serves 3-4, as a side<br /><br />1 cup RiceSelect Arborio Rice/Risotto<br />1 tablespoon olive oil<br />1/3 cup cooking wine (we've tried all kinds)<br />4-5 cups chicken broth<br />1 - 1 1/2 cups grated parmesan cheese (NOT the powder kind)<br />1 tablespoon butter (optional)<br /><br />Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a shallow saucepan over medium heat and add risotto rice.  Stir risotto for a couple of minutes then add cooking wine.  CAUTION:  the wine will cook off rapidly and could cause steam that will burn you if you're not careful!  Stir 30 - 60 seconds until all wine has been absorbed then add 1 cup chicken broth.  SAME CAUTION AS ABOVE!  Stir constantly until broth has been absorbed, then add another 1/2 cup of broth.  Repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  Wait until the previous amount of broth has been absorbed/cooked off before adding the next.  It typically takes about 20 minutes to make the risotto.  You'll know you're ready for the next step when the Risotto is soft, but not mushy.  You'll notice as you're adding chicken broth, that most of the liquid will be absorbed or cooked off, leave you will a creamy base.<br />Remove risotto from heat and add one cup parmesan cheese.  Stir until melted.  Serve immediately.  Garnish with extra parmesan cheese.<br /><br />OPTIONAL:  if after adding parmesan, the risotto seems stiff, add one tablespoon of butter.  Or if you like butter, add butter! ;-)<br /><br />RiceSelect Arborio Rice/Risotto has consistently given us great results and we're always sure to have 2 or 3 containers in the pantry."
638,B000EH4XZC,A376OJHLE6SU9Q,M. Wolf,5,"Great risotto.  I have bought this brand both in the general food stores and through Amazon.  Personally I think this brand is as good as some I find in specialty stores.<br /><br />Sometimes I take the time to fix risotto as it is traditionally prepared other times I just throw it in the rice cooker (with a few extra steps).  This rice turns out beautifully both on stove top and in the rice cooker.  It tends to be a bit creamier when prepared on stove top.  In the rice cooker it is a less creamy but still rich.<br /><br />This is my basic formula for the rice cooker<br /><br />1. Few tablespoons butter melting in rice cooker while I cut up an onion<br /><br />2. Sautee onion in butter when soft add rice<br /><br />3. Sautee rice a few minutes (here I will add dry herb and fresh garlic)<br /><br />4. Add 1/4 cup dry white wine or lemon juice for every cup of rice stir until absorbed by rice<br /><br />5. Add 1/2cup chicken broth stirring until aborbed<br /><br />6. Add remainder of chicken broth (I typically use 2 to 2.5 cups per cup of rice) close rice cooker and let it do its thing<br /><br />7. Toward end of cycle check rice add more liquid if needed (here I sometime add 1/2 cup of cream, water, chicken broth, or 1/4 cup lemon juice)  this is also where I will add fresh herbs if I am using them<br /><br />8. When done I sometimes add shredded parmesan cheese"
639,B000EH4XZC,A2I4RXYR96PXWV,Rosie Swager,1,"After using the rice twice over several months, I was cleaning out my pantry and saw bugs crawling around in the rice.  The jar was tightly sealed and nothing else in my pantry had bugs.  My only conclusion is that the eggs were in the rice to begin with.  Gross!"
640,B000EH4XZC,A2NUBL2UYWPBWR,C,3,"This particular brand of risotto seems to have been further refined to be a quick cook risotto.  While this is very convenient for the home cook to get a risotto-style dish to the table in 20-mins instead of 40, the resulting texture is dry and even gummy because the grain continues to absorb the sauce and loose its shape even as it is ladled out for service.  Once everyone is ready to eat, the chances are that there is no sauce and the rice is overly soft.<br /><br />To be able to gauge this precisely one needs to make this in the traditional way (instead of in a pressure cooker) and pulling out before done, all the while reserving some sauce on the side to be poured on the rice at service.  Because of its enhanced-absorbent nature, this rice will continue to absorb any moisture and is unsuitable to be eaten as leftovers unless morphed into a different dish such as a porridge or arancini (rice ball).<br /><br />In essence, this is a quick-cook type of risotto that is mainly for a cook-now-eat-instantly type of meal.  If serving risotto as part of a longer more elaborate meal, use another brand as this will not sit well on the plate."
641,B000EH4XZC,ABKMVAM7J0XRU,Donna L. Mattingly,5,"I have 3 different types of RiceSelect rice on subscription to be delivered automatically because I use so much of it. This rice is really versatile, I know my cookbook says to use it in puddings but if I cook it on 'Sushi' setting in my fuzzy logic machine it makes a great tasting white rice, fluffy and kind of chewy. Consistency just right."
642,B000EH4XZC,A28QTVEFQX6Y9X,Annette,5,"I've tried a few different brands, but this is my favorite.  And it's much less on Amazon than buying it at the grocery store.  Definitely recommend"
643,B000EH4XZC,A1FCLC6F7T7X90,Word2TheWize,4,Was my first time purchasing this rice. I thought the jars would be bigger but then again I'm used to shopping at those big club stores. lol . I made some Mexican Rice Pudding with this rice and it came out so smooth and creamy. Just excellent. I was overall satisfied with my purchase. Was delivered quickly.
644,B000EH4XZC,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,Steven A. Peterson,5,"I made my first risotto just a few months ago. I searched allrecipes.com and tried the ""Gourmet mushroom risotto""--and became addicted! Even though there are only two of us for meals, I have made the full 6 servings recipe, so that I can munch away at this treat for a few days.<br /><br />I have not tried other Arborio rice, so I can't make any comparisons. But the RiceSelect version produces a tasty dish. I know that one must be patient in making risotto and not go to another room to watch television. But if you stay with the dish and nurture it, the patience is well rewarded.<br /><br />The mushroom version goes as follows. Warm some chicken broth. In a saucepan, heat mushrooms in olive oil. Cook until soft and remove mushrooms and their liquid. Stir some shallots into a skillet and cook a minute or so. Then add the Arborio rice, stirring it to coat with the oil until it takes on a golden color. Pour in wine, stirring constantly until the wine is absorbed. Then, stir in chicken broth in three different stages, stirring until absorbed. Remove the rice from the heat, stir in mushrooms and liquid, butter, chives, and parmesan cheese and, if you wish, season with salt and pepper. The end result is yummy and kicks up a meal considerably as a side dish.<br /><br />In fact, writing about this recipe, I think I'll make some risotto with dinner tonight!<br /><br />Anyhow, this Arborio rice makes excellent risotto."
645,B000EH4XZC,A1ZX6RUBAI2YOL,K. Hejna,4,"This rice makes up into perfectly decent risotto when you follow package directions. This is not an Italian rice, it is an Italian-style rice, that has cooking properties similar to Arborio rice. The jar is big, and you get 4 of the big jars, so plan to eat a lot of rice. I'm hoping to experiment and find some new ways to cook the basic product so I can have more variety than I get from small variations in the cheese and vegetables that I mix in. Judging from posted recipes, everyone goes to the same variations (parmesan/asiago/romano with asparagus/spinach).  Makes a meal with a breast from a little roast chicken from the grocery store."

648,B000HZ9D60,A4Z104CSR29W,Mary,5,"My cat couldn't keep food down and went from 10 lbs to 6 in a short period of time despite lots of vet visits and a $600 endoscopy. He seemed to be slipping away. After reading about possible food allergies and the fact that cats don't need any carbohydrates since they are obligate carnivores, I examined a lot of cat-food labels at my local super pet store, looking for an all-meat food. This is the only one I found. My cat immediately began gaining weight and has been completely healthy since he started eating it about six weeks ago. He has remained slim, active and playful. I wish more people would realize that carbohydrates aren't good for cats! And since it's canned, he gets the moisture he needs."
649,B000HZ9D60,A35R32TA60XD57,M. Torma,5,"This one is a hard review to write because my cats love the food and I do think it is a top quality one, but I won't be buying it from Amazon again.  Don't get me wrong, I have done business with Amazon for over 2 decades and the very few problems that have come up, have always been solved to my satisfaction. To order this product though you have to do business with Pet Food Direct and that is what I will not do again.  I had a problem with this order and I talked to 3 different people at PFD, one of which was a supervisor, and none of them would help me.  They were terrible to deal with and all I got from them was to send it back at my own expense when I got it and they would refund my purchase price minus the shipping.  I then talked to customer service at Amazon, who never disappoints, and they made it right for me.  When you talk to them, they really want to help you and are so friendly!  NOT so at Pet Food Direct...at all!  I wish Amazon would start selling this with the super saver shipping, but until they do I will be buying more by taking a drive to Petsmart.  Sorry."

My cats love this food (almost every flavor...) and have been doing great on it. My over wieght boy has slimmed down quite a bit since switching him to only wet food and this brand (mostly, I also feed them some EVO cans as well). One of my favorite things about it is that it doesn't contain any grains, not even rice, and is relatively inexpensive for a quality brand. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to feed their cats a great diet, but don't have the time or money to feed raw."

The one thing he won't eat is natural and organic cat food without byproduct.  We had to give the crazy expensive wellness food away to a friend since he wouldn't eat it and would just meow at the stop of his lungs that he hated it.<br /><br />My other cat a tabby won't eat wet food, she hates it.  She makes my orange cat eat it out of her bowl before she touches her dry food I mix it with.<br /><br />This food changed everything.  We were given a can of this to try, and my tabby wouldn't let the orange one near her bowl, and went back 3 times to eat more and bury her food.

He would gobble down whole cans of food and then immediately throw it back up. The vet's only recommendation was to keep switching to different brands of food -- at no time did he tell us to avoid the filler that most manufacturers add to their food. After a little searching on the internet, I saw that perhaps it was the additional ingredients which may be the cause of his upset stomach. By Nature was the only brand at PetSmart that had such a high content of natural ingredients, both in the dry and canned food; it doesn't contain corn, wheat or soy. He's been eating By Nature for 2 weeks now, is looking much better and has gained back some of his weight. Yes, it's more expensive than the other brands but it's well worth it for a happy, healthy cat."

Then, each is wrapped in a plastic to maintain freshness !!  I was blown away by the packaging already at this point.

667,B007Q3ZJ8W,A2N2D09UPJJ6ZE,L. Parsons,5,What a joy to have iced tea in just a couple minutes.  The flavors are wonderful and so good in this hot weather.<br />I recommend this sampler to anyway that loves tea.

671,B000EH4XZM,A1D0A78Z1Q73N9,L. K. Saunders,5,"My family loves rice.  I discovered this blend at one of our local groceries, but they are not consistent in stocking it.  It sells out quickly and then may not reappear for weeks.  And it is the only store in town that carries it.  I was thrilled with the opportunity to buy it by the case online.  The price is very competitive with the local grocery, and shipping was fast.  This is easily one of the best rice blends I have found.  And it is NOT seasoned, so you do not have to contend with high sodium content or other problems. You make it the way you want it--cook it in broth, add vegetables & herbs and some diced chicken or leftover beef for a quick skillet meal that is head & shoulders above a boxed skillet dinner. We all really love this rice--the blends of rice give it a nice texture and taste and it is so much healthier than white rice, yet it cooks as quickly.  Try this one--you will like it!"
672,B000EH4XZM,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""",5,"An Amazon Friend reviewed the Texmati White Rice recently. Today when I took this out of its spot, I thought: People should know how good this Royal Blend white, brown, wild, and red rice really is.<br /><br />Here I am on a two-fold mission: one, to explain this lovely blend and two, to suggest other uses for the empty container. How I found this rice is maybe unusual. When I am normal, I zip through the grocery store, attending business, then I'm out of there. When I am depressed, I spend two hours in the store. I look at everything. I imagine my life another way. With this rice, I thought, how exotic could I make a meal for a small dinner party? I thought of Royal Blend served in little white ceramic Chinese rice bowls I bought in San Francisco. Set the bowl right on the plate. I have colorful plates that I mix-match for fun and variety. Serve with grilled salmon fillets. Get out a vegetable cookbook for ideas there.Everything has to be fun and cheerful. This rice certainly is colorful and fun to eat. Its slightly nutty taste and hint of crunchiness would wow the taste buds and complement the salmon.<br /><br />Cooking this rice also saves time. Mix the water, rice, butter, and seasonings all together, then cook 15 minutes as opposed to 20 for white. Besides, Royal Blend contains no fat, just a touch of sodium, 30 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of protein, and one gram of fiber, making this hands down a superior product of rice.<br /><br />The second point is the availability of the containers. Once the rice is gone, I wash the container then use it to hold my various varieties of dried beans. The plastic jars look identical and neat all lining the counter top. Add attractiveness to the look.<br /><br />Royal Blend costs a little more, but aren't you worth it?"
673,B000EH4XZM,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,Joanna Daneman,5,"If you don't like BROWN RICE but want to add more fiber to your side dish of rice, this is the one. This rice mix is savory, fragrant and cooks up lightly cruncy and tender. It is utterly delicious. It makes a great pilaf and is good just plain. We even eat it for breakfast with a bit of honey and butter. And when you finish off the rice, you have a nice container for nuts or other dry ingredients for the pantry. This is a terrific blend of rice."
674,B000EH4XZM,AIL5T6X4GTCZY,Ted Paxton,5,"It cooks in 15 minutes.<br /><br />It smells great.<br /><br />The 4-grain mixture looks good.<br /><br />Has a chewy texture that feels good.<br /><br />Remember, DO NOT use too much water. This robs the taste and the texture (particularly because of the white portion).  In fact, I add a little less water than the directions recommend.<br /><br />Also, give it an initial stir; the white rice tends to settle to the bottom.<br /><br />Nice Reusable (Plastic) jars."
675,B000EH4XZM,A2M459TAWSBBOB,E. Mitchell,5,"Ordered this early in the year and find we use it for all sorts of dishes. Much more interesting than just brown or white rice, the combination produces a great flavor and great texture. We will be buying more after we use up our current order. Update May 2007: Have ordered more. This rice is excellent in a variety of dishes and is priced nicely too, at least compared to the alternatives in our local grocery store. My favorite recipe: Cook with some added bouillion or real chicken stock, add 1 to 2 tsp butter, add some dry or chopped onion, sage, basil, oregano and whatever else you feel like and cook as normal (15 to 20 minutes)."

This one, with its blend of grains, fit the bill. I made it yesterday with water, some butter, minced garlic, and a dash of salt. The result was FANTASTIC. Seriously, this is probably the best rice I've ever had.<br /><br />Tonight I used a half tablespoon of olive oil instead of the butter, and the rice came out just as good. Seriously folks, this stuff is amazing. It has a soft texture that almost seems to melt in my mouth. It has a slightly nutty flavor and it almost reminds me of popcorn.<br /><br />Both last night and tonight, I had planned to dice up some chicken and put it in the rice, but after taking just one sample bite of the rice, I couldn't wait for the chicken. This is the kind of rice I would expect to find at a chic 4-star restaurant.<br /><br />Folks, I cannot get over how amazing this rice is. GET IT. You won't be sorry."
678,B000EH4XZM,A3BXCB3LGIE495,meemee,5,I will continue to keep RiceSelect on hand. This rice doesn't get pasty and stick together. The packaging keeps the rice fresh after opening so you don't have to transfer it to another container. The perfect side dish. Plus it cooks quickly.

It is the only quick cooking rice blend that includes wild, red and brown rice. It is very tasty, easy to make, and I make it often.<br /><br />I do not follow their cooking directions, however. I brown the rice mixture in butter before adding the water.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it does contain white rice. I would prefer not to eat white rice. I would like it even better if it were organic."

I eat it several nights a week.  It goes great with chicken and steamed vegetables for a healthy dinner.  There are no additives, just an assortment of different rice.  It also has an interesting texture, not too crunchy, but not mushy like white rice.<br /><br />For a healthy solution to side dishes with MSG like rice-a-roni or even semolina pasta, this is the best I've found!"

The orzo is pretty good, but the rice, oh, the rice, what a terrible disappointment. I was surprised to see that the directions call for such a short cooking time, and sure enough, it did cook that fast. That might sound like a good thing, but the rice came out quite mushy. Looking more closely at the uncooked product, it sure looks to me like it has been processed in some way prior to packaging (maybe it has been parboiled then dried?). In any case, I'm so disappointed by this rice I'm going to give it away to a food bank and just go back to buying rice at my local health food store.<br /><br />If I'm right about the processing of this rice, it should be noted in the product info, and it isn't. If I had bought this locally I would be returning the 3 unopened jars, but it just seems like too much hassle to worry about and I'm sure the food bank will be happy to have it.<br /><br />I have bought literally hundreds of items from Amazon, and this is the first one I've felt compelled to comment on.

712,B002N4KDV2,AL7R5LO0AUGKQ,"M. ""-- M.""",5,"My old cat who died last year had diabetes because I didn't understand the basic principles of feline nutrition. After he was diagnosed, I switched him to a canned food diet with multiple small feedings per day, and that was actually enough to get him off insulin!<br /><br />Although I would have done anything to prevent his diabetes, I didn't appreciate how unfussy it made him until he died and I got another cat. The old cat would eat anything. The new cat would starve himself to death before he'd eat something that doesn't meet his standards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's particularly fussy about canned food. He doesn't like pate-style or ground foods - if I even want there to be a prayer of him eating it, it has to have shredded meat. That's why I was so pleased to discover this brand.<br /><br />First of all, I love the ingredient list. The foods are balanced and grain-free (so important!) and don't contain unnecessary chemicals or preservatives. The only ingredient I'm less than thrilled about is the tapioca starch (used for thickening), but it's listed after the protein sources I really don't worry about it. When I was first considering this brand, I checked out reviews for it on other websites, and there were a lot of people upset that some of the flavors contain menadione. I looked into this, and it's a form of vitamin K which is an essential additive in fish-based foods because they don't contain enough natural vitamin K and it's required for health. The controversy appears to be based in that it was banned for humans...after a bunch of babies died when they were given great big whopping doses. Fortunately, the amount of menadione added is so minuscule that I'm totally comfortable with its inclusion. (And since it's not present in the chicken-based formulas, and since I think poultry is a better staple food for cats than fish, he gets that much less of it.)<br /><br />Actually, the chicken and pumpkin flavor seems to be his favorite. I was a little unsure of using pumpkin, since cats are carnivores and carbohydrates can have some bad effects, but it's apparently good for their digestion. Since I rotate the different flavors, the possible consequences are really reduced...and since cats seem to like to barf just to keep things interesting, I'm pleased about any possible stabilizing effect!<br /><br />Soulistic's website also promises to use human-grade ingredients. No by-products here! It even smells like regular people food, which, let me tell you, is a welcome relief.<br /><br />But the best part: the cat loves it. He doesn't refuse it, he's not even merely indifferent to it - he devours it. I've tried every single flavor of the ""in gravy"" flavors (I haven't tried the ""in gelee"" flavors) and every single one of them sends him into raptures.<br /><br />Seriously, it doesn't get any better than this. There's a canned grain-free cat food with a high moisture content and shreds or chunks of real meat and fish as the first ingredients, and the cat loves it. There are enough flavors to give him variety, both in taste and nutrition. I'm sold!"
713,B002N4KDV2,A1RDHASSNJE6XE,m,2,"Having purchased the Soulistic ""Gelee"" and BFF (made by the same company) I wanted to try the ""Gravy"" flavors to add some more variety.  Although the food looks appetizing and all the cats seem to like the food, I was dismayed to see that there seemed to be as much gravy as food in the cans.  I do not want to be paying the same price for cans that contain this much liquid and less food.  I will purchase the ""Gelee"" foods and BFF again, but it isn't likely that I will purchase the ""Gravy"" flavors."

Now living on the East Coast, I became disgusted with the overly-sugary, fake-tasting coconut flakes found in typical grocery stores, so I was delighted to find this product. I mix these coconut flakes with some of the coconut milk powder and warm water, and after letting the flakes soak for a few minutes, I eat the mixture straight out of the bowl.

First, the selection of mushrooms is excellent and includes a lot of exotic varieties, including the Wood Ear, that are not available to most Americans across this country. Secondly, the packaging is good because it is plastic, easily recyclable, and one can simply re-hydrate ALL the mushrooms in a single container and then use what one wants, save the rest in the refrigerator AND use the reserved liquid in some sort of other dish (I like to use it in a Ragu sauce with mushrooms to enhance the flavor).<br /><br />As for the complaint that it is ""from China"", every country has different levels of production and quality. There are clothes ""Made in the USA"" that are made in sweatshops. And the same goes for China. There are different qualities of product and production.

If you are making two deep dish pies buy the 29 oz can which is far more economical.<br /><br />This is what comes in the can: 100% pure pumpkin....which can also be called pumpkin puree or solid pack pumpkin. Nothing else, so salt, no preservatives.  The pumpkin is cooked during the canning process so you could eat it straight from the can, should you so desire.<br /><br />The pumpkin pie recipe is on the back of the can. I've tried other, fancier, more complicated recipies over the years but have always come back to the tried and true because, to me, this is what pumpkin pie is supposed to taste like. You get a fragrant and flavorful pie with an excellent texture. The recipe calls for sugar, evaporated milk, eggs, cinnamon, ground cloves, ground ginger, and salt. I add 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg and a dash of white pepper. Also, I like to slightly froth the eggs because it gives the filling a smoother and more delicate texture.<br /><br />The recipe calls for baking the pie 15 minutes at 425 and then 40-50 minutes at 350. I cover the crust with foil for the first 25 minutes to keep it from getting too brown. Also, I find that 40 minutes at 350 is more than enough. Don't overbake! If a knife comes out clean from the center of the pie, its done.<br /><br />On average, this 15 oz can should be about two dollars and fifty cents at a supermarket.<br /><br />One last thing, if you remove the label from the can, you will find other recipies and helpful tips printed on the other side. Its a total win-win!"
729,B0005ZYSIA,A2T4JWIRGGHFIT,Badger,5,"I give my dog a tablespoon of canned pumpkin daily to aid his digestive system but he sees it as the best treat! Libby's uses a variety of pumpkin that seems to have more fiber, less water, than other kinds of canned pumpkin. The difference in pumpkin variety, at least for my pup, makes a HUGE difference between it helping his tummy & adding to the problem. He only seems to benefit from the Libby's pumpkin, the other makes his diarrhea worse.<br /><br />I highly recommend giving a little canned pumpkin daily if your dog suffers w/ food allergies &/or digestive troubles - unusually it can help both constipation & diarrhea depending on what they're suffering with. Canned pumpkin can also help dogs who have have trouble w/ congested anal glands have fewer problems &/or lengthen the amount of time between needing them expressed.<br /><br />It's ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO TALK W/ YOUR VET BEFORE adding anything to your dog's diet to be sure it's the right thing for your dog - ALWAYS check w/ your vet first. Be advised that feeding too much, depending on your dog's needs, can cause diarrhea to be worse OR it could cause constipation. Talk to your vet FIRST & be sure to ask the appropriate amount & way to feed to your dog. The size of the dog is important to how much to give them daily, as is the state of their tummy. My dog is 55 lbs, has food allergies, & a tendency towards diarrhea & a tablespoon a day is enough to keep the balance for his tummy issues... enough to prevent diarrhea but not so much as to cause constipation. I give it to him off of a spoon, as a treat, but you can mix it w/ their kibble if they're an especially sloppy eater!<br /><br />Pumpkin, as well as sweet potato, is a terrific treat for dogs w/ food allergies. But again, check w/ your vet first!"

I didn't have evaporated milk or I didn't want to look for it and made the recipe with just the eggs and spices.  One hundred percent pumpkin puree is a great idea!  Last month, purveyors in ""aristocratic"" New York were selling pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving for $50 each.  Considering how many Manhattanites and Brooklynites are originally out of towners who are not unfamiliar with canned food, I'm really amazed at how many rich people there are in New York City who are comfortable paying these prices.  We finally landed a perfectly acceptable 5-inch pie from Whole Foods supermarket that we didn't even finish - the price was $5.99.<br /><br />Some people may find this recipe too strongly spiced.  Wolfgang Puck's recipe is basically less of the spices and more eggs and milk to the same amount of pumpkin puree so that means one is at liberty to adjust the measurements as one pleases."

759,B000H7ELTM,A2Q8GFSEUSGJ51,S. WIlliams,4,"My son (toddler) is obsessed with blueberries. They're his favorite snack. Fresh can be very expensive in winter--and less than tasty.<br /><br />I usually like organic, but many of the organic dried blueberry options are dry and super tiny. (Probably because organic blueberries tend to be smaller to start with.) They're also quite expensive, especially at the rate we go through them.<br /><br />For the price, and based on the positive reviews, I decided to give these a try. The first batch I got from Amazon was terrible. Dry, small little husks. I was upset since, even these these are a good bulk value, $50 is far from chump change, especially for a grocery item. But Amazon stepped up, assuring me it wasn't a systemic problem and sent me a new batch ASAP.<br /><br />They were right. Night and day. (I must have originally got an old unit or something.) They're large plump and great in baked goods. (I have a ""blueberry cream"" cookie recipe that uses dried fruit and these are spectacular there.) They taste like blueberries--which is a good thing--and are good enough to eat out of hand. Home run on the second try.<br /><br />The company does offer an organic version--for twice the price, on their company website--and maybe I'll give those a go next time, funds permitting.

These blueberries are acutally better than the ones I was buying before, because they don't have High Fructose Corn Syrup. Sugar is actually healthier and tastes better. I will buy these again and again."
761,B000H7ELTM,A30Y6933LWCQTH,Dragon Slayer,2,Too bad they don't have a sugar-free option.  They taste like raisins with all the sugar.  Good perhaps with breakfast food but not so much for a snack.

I thought I was getting a deal buying these.<br /><br />The blue berries in this pack are very small, yes blue berries are small berries but the berries used by Traverse are extremely small compared to other brands.  The size of the berries was not my main issue with the content of the package I bought.  All berries come with a small amount of oil added to prevent caking.  Traverse uses way to much oil to the point where the flavor of the berries is effected by it.<br /><br />These berries did not taste like the blue berries I had purchased before, all I could taste was the oil.  The berries resembled and tatsed like dried and oiled olives except much smaller.  I did not enjoy them and if I did not toss out the packaging I would of returned them.<br /><br />I would recommend going with a different brand, if not then buy the smaller package first as so you can make sure you like them before spending $50+ dollars on the larger package such as this one."

They arrived in 2 days as promised in excellent condition/packaging, even in this heat wave New England is having right now. While they do look a lot like raisins, upon closer look (with my glasses and a light on), they are deep purplish/blue and glossy. Soft and plump, not hard like raisins. I don't find the sweetness to be too much, although I can't recall the last time I used sugar in/on anything, including during my childhood (just don't like sweet foods). The 'sugar' is not visible as on some raisins and the berries are not overly sticky to the touch. There are a few clumps, but when picked up, they break apart without any effort.<br /><br />These are great as a snack in hand (I know: I'm munching while making blueberry breakfast bread!) to be followed by a homemade trail mix with dried cranberries, almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, flaxseeds, sesame seeds, some granola that is laying around and coconut.<br /><br />Best bargain I've found for blueberries, including fresh and then freezing or drying my own.

The oil coating and sugar had me worried.<br /><br />Was relieved to discover upon delivery that they were all I could hope for:  simply BEAUTIFUL BERRIES!!!<br /><br />No discernable sweetness to my tastes and a wonderful blueberry flavor.  The berries have a luscious lingering trace of berry tartness which is PERFECT for the use I have in mind...... to balance the (semi) sweetness present in my chocolate chip cookies.
774,B000H7ELTM,AJMH1S1H2GUQC,"Laura Garrett ""Registered Dietitian, Personal...",5,Blueberries are full of antioxidants. Adding them to your diet is an excellent healthy addition. Keeping fresh blueberries on hand isn't always an option for our on-the-go family. These dried blueberries have been an excellent way to get the nutritional benefits of blueberries. This particular item is delicious and of good quality. I love that it is sold in bulk and can be set up on the subscribe & save = super convenient!
775,B000H7ELTM,A2SA6LR78V49UV,"OrangeCrush ""Still shooting with Film!""",5,"I actually live in Michigan and every year head up to Traverse City for the cherry fest. It was during a cherry fest like 6-7 years ago that I was introduced to Traverse Bay dried fruits. I have never eaten another brand since. If you like dried fruit then look no further. Traverse Bay sells Dried Cherries, Dried Organic Cherries, Dried Organic Blueberries, Dried Wild Blueberries, Dried Red Raspberries, and Dried Strawberries. Just check out the companies homepage. They even offer subscription based shipping just like Amazon. They also sell a bunch of other stuff as well including antioxidant fruit based vitamins, Jams, fruit concentrates, etc..<br /><br />While dried cherries and dried cranberries are my favorites, I still really enjoy dried blueberries. I have actually tried a lot of different brands over the years and none of them have the quality, freshness and flavor that Traverse Bay has. I eat them out of the box, on cereal, in salads, and even in homemade ice cream. Dried blueberries, or any other dried fruit for that matter, is just a great snack.<br /><br />The bottom line - If your looking for high quality dried blueberries then look no further.<br /><br />5 Stars!"
776,B000H7ELTM,A3AM1VNSPSYASP,"Kyra_Athena ""Kyra_Athena""",5,"I love to bake and make dry snack mixes, like trail mix, so these are ideal for me.  They are on hand and I don't have to worry about using them before they spoil like fresh ones.  I also like frozen ones, but sometimes these are best if you don't want the blue color to bleed into your batter or don't need additional liquid.  Consider how much you can use prior to purchasing or split this with someone.  It too me a LONG time to go through this box.  Compared to the fresh price around here ($5.99 for a 1/4 pint), this is definitely a good deal."

So we ordered this 4 pound box of Traverse Bay Blueberries, though I was disappointed they felt the need to add sugar and oil to them (I usually use no sugar on anything).  But...these berries are great!<br /><br />I put them in a glass of water overnight in the fridge, and the next morning they are plump and juicy, and ready to eat straight, or to put in my homemade muesli or blueberry pancakes.  I even pour a bit of the tasty blue liquid left over onto my pancakes or waffles.<br /><br />This is the best price on dried blueberries that I've found, and I'm very happy with them.  And 4 pounds goes a long ways-especially if you hydrate them (eating them dry seems such a waste, because you don't quite get the flavor; if I want to eat dried ones, I might as well save money and eat some good cheap raisins).<br /><br />It would be nice if they could just sell them without the oil and sugar, but if I'd not read the ingredients on Amazon, I'd have never known from the taste that they weren't just unadulterated blueberries."

799,B0054ETSLE,A7GF6V6KYUVAM,cllgal2005,2,I bought this product to use as party favors for my sons 8th Geology themed birthday party. I chose these for the price because they are cheaper than buying the rock candy on the sticks. The rocks are bigger than I expected but they were in pretty bad shape. Most of the rocks were fused together and you cannot even see the strings on most of them. I cannot even tell if they all have strings in them. Most of the strings were broken into small pieces. Besides the size of the individual rocks themselves I was not very happy with this product.

The many pieces of walnut sprinkled throughout the cheese were the perfect compliment to the buttery, tangy, and nutty gouda, already a rich cheese. The cheese came with a yellow paraffin wax rind which came off easily and the cheese sliced easily. The taste was everything I expected with a nice buttery yet very tangy gouda flavor and the dense crunch of the walnuts with just enough walnut flavor for a great overall experience. I served this mostly on a cheese plate to compliment some cheddars, with tart apples, and grapes, but it was also excellent melted on a chicken panini sandwich and as an hors d'oeuvre melted in a phyllo shell with bacon and leeks. iGourmet ships it re-packaged and re-labeled in a vacuum-sealed thick plastic and ships in an insulated bag with gel packs so the cheese arrives in perfect condition. I was very pleased with this purchase and would definitely buy this again."
802,B003TJ0Y1O,A35N9Y3251FMFN,Nite Webber,4,"Compared to fresh stuffed grape leaves I've had at Costco, these have more oil (sunflower) and thus more fat and aren't quite as good.  These don't have tomato in them and the rice is more mushy.  They're really packed tight in the can, so it is a bit difficult to get them out intact.  Also, I just bit into a small piece of red onion skin which I was unable to chew.  They're not a bad deal though for six cans and I don't regret buying them.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by the fresher ones I've had."
803,B003TJ0Y1O,A1MOGC2U0QUS55,Kathy Tesh,2,"I was looking forward to having these stuffed grape leaves and serving them to guests (thank goodness I tasted them first), but was extremely disappointed. I opened the first can and found every one of the stuffed grape leaves were very tough (center vein was unchewable). Well, I thought, maybe it's just this can - so I opened the second can. Exact same complaint - the grape leaves are old and tough and I couldn't chew it. I had to spit it out. I will say the flavor was good on the whole but when you can't chew it that's a big ""no no""!"
804,B003TJ0Y1O,A133AOJAF7671T,R. Deuro,4,"I grew up on homemade grapeleaves and have been looking for an easy way to get some.  These grapeleaves taste better than what I can order in some restaurants.  The flavors are blended together well.  I suggest rinsing the grapeleaves after you open the can, since they are a bit oily, and then keeping them in the fridge.  They taste better chilled and are firmer.  You get about 18 leaves in the can, 6 cans per pack.  This is a great deal for people who want grapeleaves in a hurry.  Highly recommended!"
805,B003TJ0Y1O,A2ACDH9MNFSQAJ,A. Conner,1,"I have made dolmades and have had some really good ones out of a can, but these were not good.  The flavor was right, but the rice was overcooked and soggy, mushy, and very unpleasant in texture.  I gave the five cans I hadn't opened away with a warning about the rice."
806,B003TJ0Y1O,A2FD9B8CMYY78R,GoodCustomer,5,"Pretty dang good for a canned rice product. Decent taste, bite, etc. Good, tender leaves. They are indeed packed in there tight, but I suspect that keeps them intact better. It's not unique to these, but they keep real well in a covered dish in the refrigerator. I haven't found out how long you can get away with, but they didn't go bad are three or four weeks when I forgot they were in there."

811,B00355HJCO,A23MKWR1JKRHO4,"GreenEyedGirl ""GreenEyedGirl""",1,I bought this product for the fiber in prune juice to aid in my son's constipation. Compared to regular prune juice which has about 1.5 g fiber in 4 oz this juice has 0 g fiber in the same volume. The ingredients just list apple and prune juice but don't list how much of each. Clearly it's more apple than prune. If your kid likes to drink apple and prune juice then this product is fine but if you're looking for something to help with constipation you should look elsewhere.  What a waste.

The box seems about the same size as always, but the tiny little downsized cakes just shake around in it. I hope the stock holders are happy this year, because this is the last box I will ever buy. Even at two boxes for the price of one, these pint-sized cakes are no bargain. If they down-size them again, shoppers will have to buy two boxes to put together one little cake. The cakes are delicious, but barely big enough to taste anymore. There are still some generic companies out there making full-sized cakes, and, in light of this ridiculous miniaturizing, I would wholeheartedly recommend them over Hostess."

All the brick and mortar grocery stores seem to offer just little tiny spice rack bottles of chili, about what is needed to make one nice pot of chili, at exorbitant prices. Buying this chili powder in bulk has been my private little consumer revolt.<br /><br />I am not qualified to comment on how this chili powder compares to other brands. But I do make no-frills, old-fashioned chili pretty often, and this chili powder has produced good results. Neither too wimpy for me, a spicy food lover, nor too spicy for my wife, who likes things mild. This chili powder, on its own, produces strong flavor without major heat. For a bit more of a kick, I mix in cayenne pepper.<br /><br />Don't let the corner grocery store rob you on chili powder any more. This is two pounds of chili powder.

They are not just for baking. You can be creative and add a handful wherever you want a bit of sweetness in a savory dish. Because they are tiny they can be a bit dry so it's best to soak them and drain them well before using. Or keep them in a container in the refrigerator after you've soaked and drained the entire box.

I received the 8 O'Clock ""Original"" coffee which is 100% arabica beans but is NOT Colombian. Based upon a 2009 review, for this same product, another consumer had the same problem. Fortunately, as this is fulfilled by Amazon returning it for a full refund was easy breezy and return shipping was paid by the merchant or Amazon.<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee but I would encourage you to buy it from another source at Amazon's Web site or you'll likely not get the product that's advertised and even though returns and refunds are handled professionally and promptly by Amazon, it's still a hassle to have to tape the box up, put the label on, and take it to the Post Office and retain the tracking number so you'll know Amazon received it in case the refund is not issued in a timely manner upon receipt of the return by Amazon."

If you call the company they tell you it's available at Super Walmarts ( we don't have 'super' Walmarts and the others do NOT carry it) and when I would try to order online everything would go fine until I put in my address and then the seller would say "" sorry we cannot ship gourmet items to Hawaii"". So finally I find a company , God bless em, who will ship here ( Hawaiian coffee is quite expensive by the way, especially pure  Kona which can be over $30 lb) and I purchased Eight O'clock Columbian (AH - Light Vienna Roast-not burned beans- and higher in caffeine too) in the largest bag available 42oz ....and it arrived! YEAH! I have only one small complaint which is the shipping cost ...very high ... You can ship items like this via USPS Priority Mail for less than half of what I was charged here and it would have arrived in 3-5 days.

It was explained that dehydrated was a good go between when switching a dog from regular unhealthy processed food to a raw diet.  I decided to try it.  I bought the trial 4 oz. box.  In the past, my dog has been the pickiest eater there is.  He will only eat one brand of food...and believe me I have tried them all.  When I feed him, the food sits in the bowl and he nibbles.  It takes an entire day for him to eat one cup of food.  I removed his food bowl last night and didn't feed him.  I figured I would let him get good an hungry.  This morning, I measured out 1/2 cup of Thrive and heated up 1/2 cup of water.  When I mixed it, it looked like soup.  After I let it re-hydrate it looked even worse.  I figured he would never eat it.  I set it down and he ATE THE WHOLE BOWL in one sitting.  Maxx LOVES it.  I just ordered a 10 lb. box.

My son is convinced that it cures his headaches and it seems to have helped my daughter's seasonal allergies. I CAN tell you that this brand of mangosteen juice tastes really good compared to Xango (although Xango is good too) and it is much cheaper. Still, I will have to use it for a longer period of time to know if it helps with other ailments, such as arthritis.<br /><br />I appreciate that the product tell what percentage of mangosteen it actually contains (50%). I've tried to find out the percentage in Xango, but have been unable to do so.<br /><br />Bottom line? If you are worried about using aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen, for your aches and pains, this may be a healthy alternative.

These would be great in or on a pumpkin pie with the added flavor, or even added to some ice cream.  if you have a sweet tooth, than perhaps these are not for you.

This creates the illusion you have put a lot more work into the dinner than you actually did.<br /><br />I highly recommend it. I bought many jars of this from a local grocery before they stopped carrying it. Which is a shame. I've tried many others since and nothing compares to this.
854,B000JMFCL6,A211AUCQVUDHY7,D.,5,"My favorite Indian cuisine is from the South, and Patak's Madras curry paste is a good first step in using some of its flavors, particularly tamarind, which is hard to find outside of Indian food stores.<br /><br />There are some natural limitations to this paste because you have a fixed proportion of spices - The best results come from using it in ""dry"" cooking like sauteeing. Contrary to the vegetarian cuisine of South India, this paste is superb as a marinade or glaze for grilled meat (you don't have to add anything else) - the result is like a Southeast Asian satay.<br /><br />However, in ""wet"" cooking, like curry or dal, the proportions are off and you'll want to use your own spices if you can. In this case, at least the paste gives you an easy source of tamarind flavor.<br /><br />It is not quite hot enough for me, but you can always add chiles. The ginger flavor is kept tastefully subtle  - something I find difficult when using my own spices. This paste is a welcome product since using the right balance of spices from scratch is a skill that takes time to develop."

I cannot figure out how they make it taste like pie with only these ingredients but they do. How wonderful to have an item with such a short healthy ingredient list.<br /><br />My second favorite so far is the Lemon Bar, it's really good too, and has only 5 ingredients.

864,B0018KR8V0,A3T0OTH5072YRE,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""",5,"Yum!  This was my first experience with a Larabar and I really liked it.  I love key lime pie to begin with, so I was beyond excited to find a bar in that flavor.<br /><br />While it didn't taste exactly like a Key Lime Pie, this bar did have a lot of lime flavor.  It also had some crunchy nuts that contrasted nicely with the almost fruit chews texture of the rest of the bar.  I also was able to taste the hint of coconut in there as well.  Between those three flavors, it tasted very fresh and almost like I was eating a fruit salad in bar form.  Definitely a pleasant experience.<br /><br />The ingredient list on this bar is phenomenal.  Only 5 ingredients are in it:  dates, cashews, almonds, coconut, and lime juice.  That's it, no hard to pronounce ingredients, no added sweeteners, just plain food that is easily recognized by just about anyone.  In fact, according to the package, because of those ingredients, this bar equals 1/4 of a cup of fruit.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, this bar is about on par with most other fitness bars.  It has 220 calories, which is high for a snack but good for if you're working out or as a meal replacement.  Sugars are high, 24 grams, but at least it's from all natural foods and not because they dumped a pile of sugar in the bar.  There's also some vitamins hiding in there, but those too aren't from vitamins injected into the food.<br /><br />A pretty good bar.  I'm eager to try out the other Larabars and see if they're just as good.  And I know I'll definitely be buying this one again.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"

They're convenient to throw in my purse, and are easy to eat.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Super healthy.  Three simple ingredients, no fillers, no added sugars.<br />- Good source of protein, plus a handful of vitamins and minerals.<br />- Very tasty.  Slightly sweet, and fresh peanut taste.<br />- Soft and chewy, easy to eat.  The peanuts are ground into small pieces, which I really like.  They're plentiful and blended perfectly with the dates.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Make me thirsty.  I recommend at least a little water after eating.<br />- A bit pricey.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I just love these Larabars.  They don't taste just like a peanut butter cookie, but they do have a wonderful flavor which I found surprising given the ingredients.  I love that there is no added sugars.  One bar makes me feel great after I eat it, and there is no sugar crash later on.  With protein and fiber, it's a great choice.  Also, it's gluten-free and dairy-free for individuals who cannot consume either of those two things.<br /><br />I highly recommend!"

For the occasional ""cheat,"" I wanted something naturally sweetened without glutens or grains. Many paleo/primal websites recommend Larabars. I've eaten them before but never the Ginger Snap variety.<br /><br />O.M.G. They hit the spot and then some. What an indulgence -- and they remind me of my fattening gingerbread men from Christmas. Soft and chewy with that marvelous gingerbread taste.

They contain all natural ingredients which sounds like something for a tree hugger which I'm not; it actually makes them good and not disgusting like some other granola type bars.

The flavor wasn't all I'd hoped, given some of the reviews - they're cherry pie LaraBars with chopped peanuts added - a little peanut taste as you bite into them, and a peanut aftertaste.  What I loved about peanut butter sandwiches was the way the richness of the peanut butter contrasted with the fruitiness of the jelly.<br /><br />These bars don't do it for me, since they lack the rich peanut butter taste I love.  However, they're not at all bad in themselves (just not so good that they'd make my favorites list, where apple pie remains at the top, though I've never tried a LaraBar I really didn't like)."

The Larabar reminds me of the naturally zesty and sweet fruit rolls I used to eat as a kid but also has wonderful, flavorfull fresh nuts mixed in. Raw nuts contain healthy fats and the protein and fat in the nuts will lower the glycemic index of the food. If you don't want to lug around raw cherries and a snack bag of raw nuts, this is the convenient alternative.<br /><br />Keep in mind, these are excellent treats for pets too. They are especially nice for birds who like to pick at the dried fruit and munch on the raw nuts.

894,B0018KR8V0,A23KZBVCFKW1XS,IdaYooper,4,"First let me state that I've only tried 3 flavors so far (chocolate coconut, cocoa mole', and apple pie).<br /><br />I found chocolate coconut to be my least favorite. Normally I like the chocolate coconut combination, but in this brand it just didn't work for me!  If I had to rate it, I'd only give it 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that cocoa mole' was a huge improvement (so if you're in the mood for something chocolaty- I would highly recommend this)!!  The cinnamon/chili combo is very unique (but shouldn't be a surprise if you know what mole' is).  The cinnamon is comforting, and the chili gives it a little zing- with a faint hint of heat.<br /><br />  The apple pie flavor is so far my favorite out of the three.  You can definitely taste the distinct apple cinnamon flavor.  I'm not sure if I encountered a rasin in mine though.  I also like that it has walnuts in it.<br /><br />  Anyway, I can't wait to sample other flavors!  ..I hope they come up with a new flavor that involves macadamia nuts!!"

I recently moved to an area where TJ has little presence, if any, and ordered the bars from Amazon instead. Although the label on the box had indicated the expiration date was 10 months away, the first bar I chewed into was dry, stale, with a bitter after taste. This is disappointing because I am familiar with this product and I know what flavor to expect. I still like LaraBar and will continue to consume it but my next purchase will have to be from a brick and mortar location where I can sample an individual bar prior to purchasing a full box.<br />Upon my request Amazon had issued a full refund for this purchase. Hail Amazon!!!!"
896,B0018KR8V0,A3PAO6LO58KQ9T,J. Niblock,5,This is a great vegan and gluten free snack.  A lifesaver to have on hand when other vegan gluten free food is not available.
897,B0018KR8V0,A10O8SJ9M74Y43,"K. Shchyelkunova ""Bargain Hunter""",5,"I can't believe some people actually manage to compare these bars to Snickers or other fake-ingredient bars. Really? A 200 calories of fruit and nuts vs. hydrogenated, high-fructose, heart-attack calling candy bars should really make this decision easy.<br />I actually came across Larabars just recently. I heard about them, but I was just never too curious to actually read the ingredients and try one. To give a little background on my life-style, I do all of my own cooking to make sure I know exactly what goes into it. I stray away from all the processed foods and I don't eat grains and starches such as potatoes. I also don't eat refined sugars as it falls into a category of processed foods. With that said, I am a human being and I do get cravings for something dessert-like. I have very high standards for my dessert. It has to be all-natural, unprocessed, and preferably without added sweeteners. With all of those requirements one has to pretty much always prepare their desserts from scratch because there aren't whole lot of prepackaged foods out there that have that same philosophy about preparing it. Larabar is one of the very few out there who actually got it right.<br />I was a little skeptical about the taste of the bars when I bought a couple to sample, but they all exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be buying them in the future.<br />Now, I wouldn't overindulge in eating a few of those a day as they are still plenty sweet and carbolicious, but I usually have a few bites after lunch as a dessert treat. One bar lasts me 3-4 days and I will choose it over Snickers any time of the day."

There is no flour, sugar, eggs, chemicals, preservatives, or anything bad.<br /><br />There are only natural, healthy ingredients.<br /><br />This bar is suitable for vegans.<br /><br />This bar is suitable for health-conscious people or people on a diet.<br /><br />If you like pecan pie, but don't want to eat them because of all the bad stuff in them, then this bar should fill the bill and satsify your craving!!!!"
899,B0018KR8V0,ABXKP2NAO80LY,Curtis Stewart,3,"Unlike the Cherry Pie which is great and really taste like cherry pie, this is more of a lime flavored almond bar. Not bad, but not great."

Holter,5,"these are awesome!! they are probably my favorite brand of bars. i like how they don't contain a lot of ingredients(i think usually about 2-5) & it's all very natural stuff (probably the most natural bars out there), like dates, nuts, and stuff like that.<br />some people complain about the amount of fat, but it is all healthy fat! and fat is not bad for you.. we need it to live! our bodies could not survive without it.<br />oh and my favorite flavor is the peanut butter cookie one... i wish amazon would sell it on here!"
901,B0018KR8V0,A46ISDZA1HU4K,Heather,4,"I love Larabars and I love pistachios. Unfortunately I have found too many nutshells in my pistachio larabars. The shells I find are small, but it is bothersome to me to be chewing on something and suddenly hit something sharp and hard. I don't think I'll be buying these again, despite their good taste."
902,B0018KR8V0,A1LRLJSYIFTQUG,Listen,5,"These bars are great!  I like so many of the different flavors. It is hard to find a soy-free and dairy-free bar with some protein, so it was great to find these. On top of all the benefits, these tasted better then any granola or nutrition bar I have found!  Give these a try, you won't be disappointed."

904,B0018KR8V0,A3KYS85ISBSX5M,J. M. Walker,5,This is my favorite Larabar.<br />The lime and coconut give it a lightness to balance the richer flavors.
905,B0018KR8V0,A388C7DD1OMRZY,Eilene Edwards,5,"I love that this has a fair amount of protein and the only sugar source is directly from the fruit.  I also love that it has a VERY short ingredient list.  This is why I picked this bar for my kids, who have several allergies, including gluten and soy.  My favorite flavor by far is the Pistachio.  DS aged 4 agrees with me.  He only wants the green one!"

I've only had the Apple Pie flavor, which I was told was the best, and it was really great. I can have a sweet treat during the day, I just have to snack, but it's healthy!"
907,B0018KR8V0,A12ENBT314RFXR,"P. Gray ""The Gluten Free Assistant""",5,"I love the fact that the gluten-free products by larabar say so right on the display box in the store so it takes the guess work out of it for you. They taste just like the flavor they're supposed to and aren't too sweet for a quick snack. They still hold you over until you can get some actual food in your stomach, which is great. I keep these around as much as I can! My favorite GF flavors are key lime pie, pecan pie, apple pie, and banana nut bread."
908,B0018KR8V0,A1ZKMZ708U140P,"Lynn E. Benton ""water sign""",5,"If you love cherry pie, you will love this product. It has the tartness of cherry pie with just the right amount of sweetness. The nuts give it some crunch to make it last a little longer. All natural ingredients with no sugar added make it the perfect snack."
909,B0018KR8V0,A3BUFWY7JGT4X,Greta Y. Rossi,5,"These are terrific!  They remind me of real cherry pie, but much healthier.  don't worry about the fat content or the calories.  I lost weight eating these."

911,B0018KR8V0,A37RBOIW196V7E,Randall A. Kindig,5,"The Cashew Cookie is my favorite flavor of the Larabar.  Very tasty!  I have Crohn's Disease and am on the SCD diet.  Since this is made strictly with nuts and fruit (no other additives at all), it's a perfect snack!  I eat a couple of these each day."
912,B0018KR8V0,A3Q8WSHXGHZIMA,ch_everyounce,5,"This bar is great for getting raw fruit and nuts into your family. Could the nuts be chopped a bit smaller? Sure. But then the whole bar would be too mushy. Could they use fewer dates (to cut the sugar) and make the bar as moist? Doubtful. Cheries are tough as dried fruit goes, and I'm guessing that's the reason for the excessive dates. (Note, though, I can't stand plain dates and I don't notice the flavor or find them overwhelming. I'd just like a more tart, less sweet bar.)<br />This is the alternative to giving yourself and your family dried fruit--this bar is softer, easier to share, and slightly more flavorful than the best dried fruit. It makes nuts palatable to kids who think they don't like nuts. And that means more protein into your diet (though not as much as I'd like, it has exponentially more than plain fruit).<br />Great bar. Good price through Amazon. Stash these bars in your car, your briefcase, your desk drawer, your diaper bag, your kids' backpacks, and your family's workout bags."
913,B0018KR8V0,A1G5A8NMZT9QIL,California Vegan,5,These are wonderful for travel and snacks.  The taste is great.  Most rawfood that is suppose to taste like something cooked doesn't to me.  This does.  They have a new flavor key lime pie that is also great.

I had tried some other bars that were more fruity and had some sugar crashes. The larabars did not cause that effect on me. I have tried many of the flavors and find them surprisingly delicious for something so healthy. The cinnamon roll, cashew cookie, apple pie, and gingersnap are my favorites so far. The cherry pie was too cherry for me. This is a snack you can feel good about eating!"
915,B0018KR8V0,A1VW4L5NKA0PN9,"S. Reeves ""butterflygirl""",5,"I tried these on a recommendation from the authors of ""Skinny Bitch"" via their website.  I bought the Cherry Pie bar at my local grocery store and it was GREAT.  From the look of it and my experience with natural snack bars in the past, I was not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was VERY sweet and tasty, despite having no added sugar and all of THREE natural ingredients.  Sure, it's 200 calories, but it's filling and satisfied my (huge) sweet tooth.  I can't wait to try other flavors!"

917,B0018KR8V0,A25CAXYF2CP6CJ,Susan E. Dress,5,"Lara bars are easy to pack in a purse or desk drawer, make a full meal [for me] with a glass of milk, and taste good. I'm amazed that they are able to make so many different flavored bars using so few ingredients. Only one thing would make Lara perfect: being able to buy a 'variety' box. I don't have enough room in my small kitchen to keep a box of each kind."
918,B0018KR8V0,AP0K8XE7AIIVZ,ABP,5,"I started picking up these bars at the health food store after I had to give up granola bars.  The cherry pie bars taste amazingly like the real filling, except without all the unnecessary sugar.  The bars are sweet enough on their own and the nuts add a delightful crunch.  The other flavors are delicious as well.  The price of the individual bars can fluctuate by more than sixty cents depending on the vendor and Amazon sells them for less as a large package than the individuals would cost at the cheapest store.  The organic ingredients and lack of additives ensure that the bars are gluten-free, but are still tasty."

I have tried most of the larabar flavors and the taste and texture are delicious with all the flavors I have tried.  This is my absoulte fav with only 5 all natural ingredients.  My second choice is the pecan pie larabar.  Almost as good as this one.  I eat one for breakfast and then follow with a light mid-morning snack.

While a bit more expensive than the Cliff Bars I had been buying, these were an absolute treat and I plan to purchase more.  The all-natural raw foods approach makes for the best snack bar I've ever had - delicious, not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner.  I tried the chocolate version and found it a little too dry for my taste, but similarly well flavored."

The Chocolate Coconut is good, but the coconut flavor isn't as prominent, though it is worth getting.<br />Also if you have seen the Larabar site, they also have Maya Chocolate Bars - I got some, and my first taste was what I can only describe as 'turpentiney' - do not bother.<br />But these Larabars are a great meal replacement, or snack, and oh so healthy -<br />and a great price with Amazon."

All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar."

They are delicious, healthy, and they're the perfect little snack to keep in my bag for after the gym. BUT BE AWARE, many of the flavors (like the chocolate, cinnamon roll, and cherry pie) are all over powered by the flavor of dates. They're not bad, but there is nothing else you can taste in those flavors besides dates and nuts. I would buy one to try before investing in a whole box of the flavor you're looking for."

945,B0018KR8V0,A18CKB6R26VFDD,atlas1059,4,"I think that this series of Larabar is what a real healthy snack should contain. If you look at the ingredients on all of this series of Larabars, then you'll see that it has only 3-4 ingredients like the fruit itself, dates and some form of nuts. It doesn't have sugar, salt or other preservatives. Because of the dates, it has natural sweetness and because of the nuts, it has natural saltiness. The nuts also give this bar it's calories (an average bar is about 200 calories).  The taste is well ... not like eating a Nature Valley snack bar. The taste is more like eating mashed fruit and nuts mixed together with dates. If you don't like dates or have a thing against dates, I wouldn't buy any of this series of Larabars because 90% of them have dates as a main ingredients. I think they use it as a natural binder. Because of this, I find that a majority of their bars taste kind of the same ... heavily flavored with dates.<br /><br />But, if you're trying to snack healthily and want to avoid processed foods and those sugary / salty snacks in the ""snack bar"" aisle at the supermarket, this is the bar to go with. Plus, if you buy it in bulk from Amazon, it comes out to be less than $1.25 / bar whereas at the markets it can go as high as $2.00+ / bar.  You just need to go the market and try all the flavors first before you commit to 16 bars of the same flavor at Amazon. It would suck to order 16 bars of a flavor and find out that you can stand the taste of it after the fact."

Before I tried the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, my favorite flavor Larabar was Key Lime Pie (it tastes just like real key lime pie but is so much better for you!)  What first impressed me about Larabar is that I can pronounce all of their ingredients.  What next impressed me was that my picky 3 year old would eat them! He's now 5 and these are still his favorite snack.  Perfect way to get him some healthy, natural calories when he won't eat anything else.

We, socially, have his idea that for example if we're unwrapping the lemon bar it's going to be bright yellow, vibrant, and very lemony. Not the case. They come out brown and nutty with a light, fragrant lemon flavor. The apple pie is the same. Unwrapped it is a brownie sized cut of brown apple pulp with ample nuts mixed in; very simple, tasty, and meets my need for a quick boost of fruit that won't immediate spoil like buying the freshest of produce might."
955,B0018KR8V0,A1HOXKR7OKJ1X1,"L. R. Dana-kirby ""Leslie Dana Kirby""",5,"I have always enjoyed LaraBars and these cherry pie bars are delightful.  Just three ingredients: dates, almonds, and cherries, these bars are a great texture and slightly sour cherry flavor.  The bars are 200 calories, but you can't argue with the quality of the ingredients and these bars are very satisfying.  I look forward to trying hte other fruit and nut flavors, but I can highly recommend the cherry pie flavor!"
956,B0018KR8V0,A2EJX6SYEMNRGC,DArenas,5,"Love the flavor. It is gluten, dairy and soy free. Dates, peanuts and salt.  Can it be any simpler? Great Hunger satisfier and pick me up."
957,B0018KR8V0,A2AEYTTPMH0MZQ,"Denice ""DJS""",5,Excellent taste without the cream cheese frosting and the calories.  Hits the spot and doesn't stimulate overeating.  Good ingredients.<br /> I won't be reordering because Larabar's parent company (General Mills) is financing the fight against GMO labeling.  So sad we are  controlled by big business who are contaminating our seeds and food crops.  See John Robins blog.
958,B0018KR8V0,A2JSQCBXKZNNJO,Jason Baker,5,"Some people say these are a high fat , high calorie , high glycemic , glorified candybar. I say otherwise. Concerning fat, not all fats are equal , some being healthy . Since this bar is raw all of the fat,protein and sugar have not been denatured  which means you get the full health benefit. As far as being high calorie , considering how nutrient dense these babies are I don't consider 200 calories high in calories at all. For me 200 calories is a perfect number allowing it to be used an nutrient dense snack or a quick meal on the go.<br /><br />Concerning these supposedly being high glycemic , sure , if you were to eat the dates in these by themselves it would be , but the nuts in them bring the glycemic load of the entire bar way down , which is another benefit of the healthy fats in these bars , it allows for the sugars to be released slower and for it to digest slower making you feel full and satisfied longer.<br /><br />As far as these not being any better than a candybar I say noway! No preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup , etc, in these babies , just a healthy combo of fruit and nuts. How many nutrients does a candybar have ? Now look at the nutrient in these , loaded with minerals . Also, unlike many other foods these aren't naturally low in nutrients and then ""fortified"" with man made vitamins and minerals to make them then appear healthy. All the nutrients in these are naturally occuring which gives you the benefits in a synergistic way where other healthy compounds such as flavonoids and phenols work together with naturally occurring vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />People need to let go of the old dogma which makes them think all fat is bad but if it's sugar free then it MUST be good. If that were true then cotton candy , pepsi and skittles would all be great for ya !Fruit and nuts makes for a good healthy breakfast or snack. I'll eat my greens/green smoothies in the other meals of the day. A person shouldn't eat only fruit and nuts during the day but they shouldn't only eat greens either . These bars help make it easy to strike a balance in your diet on the go. Larabars, Pure bars , SmartMonkey bars and ThinkOrganic bars are all healthy brands of raw bars that amazon sells and all worth a try . Experiment and see what flavors you like best , or make your own !"
959,B0018KR8V0,A1YV4U8304IQ,Crystal,5,"Tropical Fruit Tart<br />5 Stars<br />This bar is very refreshing with a wonderful fruit and citrus flavor and soft chewy texture.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough<br />2 Stars<br />I'm not a fan of this flavor. The bar would be much better without the chocolate chips that somehow leave a funny aftertaste.<br /><br />Coconut Cream Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Oh my I do love coconut, and this bar was better then I expected it to be. Wonderful texture and not too chewy. This would be a great replacement for the raspberry coconut zingers I'm addicted to!<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll<br />3 Stars<br />This one didn't blow me away or disappoint so I am giving it an average review. The bar was a little harder then I would have preferred and the Cinnamon flavor could have been stronger. It should just be called Cinnamon as it does not have any flavors that could hint as being a healthy bar flavored like a cinnamon roll. If you like cinnamon you will probably like this bar but if you are indifferent to cinnamon I would skip this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie<br />3 Stars<br />This one's ok... Good texture, not nearly the amount of cashew flavor I expected for something called ""Cashew Cookie"", and it almost had a stale flavor even though it was eaten well before the best by date.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip<br />5 Stars<br />This bar definitely hit my sweet tooth. Great texture, no funny aftertaste like some of the other chocolate Larabar flavors and I would definitely put this on the list of candy bar replacements!<br /><br />Pecan Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Not overwhelmingly sweet, great pecan pie flavor, perfect soft, slightly chewy texture.<br /><br />Lemon Bar<br />5 Stars<br />Very nice Lemon flavor and a wonderful chewy texture that reminds you of an actual Lemon Bar! The Lemon lingers in your mouth quite a while.<br /><br />Banana Bread<br />1 Star<br />This bar was bitter. There's only 3 ingredients: Almonds, Dates, and Unsweetened bananas. Well bananas are naturally sweet so what was so bitter in this bar? Some people might not find this as bad as I did, but I couldn't get past the first bite.<br /><br />Apple Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Another favorite flavor. It tastes like apple pie with a few nuts. It's just perfect.<br /><br />Ginger Snap<br />5 Stars<br />Wonderful Ginger snap cookie taste! This is probably the sweetest one I've tried. Good texture, chewy and crunchy, and delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter & Jelly<br />3 Stars<br />This bar had a great texture but only a so-so flavor. I would not purchase a full box of these bars, but I would pick it over some of the others if I had a limited choice.<br /><br />Key Lime Pie<br />5 Stars<br />This was a nutty bar, which is to be expected, but the subtle hint of lime was delightful. I could stand to use even more lime flavor but the soft chewy texture and lime flavor make this one of my favorites.<br /><br />UPDATE w/Additional Flavors:<br /><br />Blueberry Muffin<br />5 Stars<br />Oh, I think I've found a new favorite! This bar has a wonderfully rich blueberry flavor without being too sweet and it reminds me of a Blueberry Oatmeal Muffin.<br /><br />Chocalate Coconut Chew<br />3 Stars<br />As a huge fan of the Coconut Cream I had high hopes for this bar but after eating it the only thing I could say was ""Where's the coconut?!"" I definitley missed the coconut texture and flavor. The chocolate flavor of this bar however was not too sweet, not overpowering, and overall the bar will suffice for a chocolate lovers craving."

The Pecan Bars are out of this world, tasting amazingly like a pecan pie!<br />Also great was their cinnamon bun bars. They were very nice in processing and helping me with these orders...BUT<br />The GREAT NEWS is Amazon has these bars for $5-6 cheaper!<br />Order through Amazon!<br />I am using this product as a meal replacement sometimes, and it has been a great hit."
962,B0018KR8V0,A1XFKWAR5STF0,"John Woods ""TObject""",5,These bars have unmistakable taste and aroma of cherries. The flavor is slightly acidic. The bars are easy to chew and generously packed with crushed almonds.
963,B0018KR8V0,A4LSU7HVACTB5,John A. Porriello,4,"I like all of the Larabars that I have tried.  They taste good and are able to satisfy my appetite.  I do not understand why the bars can be purchased cheaper at Whole Paycheck (aka Whole Foods) for $1.35 and Walmart for $1.25 and they are more expensive per unit when purchased in a box of 16 at Amazon.  Depending on which Larabar you choose, the Amazon per unit price ranges from 1.35 for the Cherry to 1.83 for the chocolate per unit.  Amazon needs to adjust its price in order to be competitive in the market."
964,B0018KR8V0,A22H0NAS6G66ZI,"A. Feucht ""miss-tenacity""",5,"Wow, I just had my first Larabar today after a long run, and I have been blown away.  As of late my preference has been for protein bars, but I had picked up a Larabar a few months ago just because it looked interesting.<br /><br />I tried the ""banana cookie dough"" flavor, since I'm a banana nut.  Unwrapping the package was difficult, though I've since found out that they have a multi-layer wrapper because there are no preservatives.  Once open, I was confronted with a raw looking rectangle of brown with pale chunks in it.  It looked moist and smelled phenomenal.  The first bite made me think ""banana bread"", and as I ate the rest of the bar I decided it wasn't quite like banana bread, but closer to that than a ""cookie"", in any case.  The pale chunks were the #1 ingredient - almonds.  The #2 and #3 ingredients were dates and bananas, respectively.  The #4 ingredient was.... nothing.  There are only 3 ingredients.  I actually flipped the wrapper over to see the continuation of the ingredients list before I realized that there was no more list!<br /><br />These bars are a little expensive for a non-protein energy bar, but the taste is like nothing you would expect from a brown rectangular smashed together food thing.  Its simply incredible, and now I have to go back and purchase the other flavors to try them out, too."
965,B0018KR8V0,A26Z6L808NGPMM,Tom Gambill,5,I am a health and fitness nut and I've tried about everything out there.  I love these bars as they are really filling and taste great (unless you are a sugar addict and need everything to have that super sweet calorie filling flavor!)  I also appreciate that I can buy cases of just one flavor at Amazon.com because the store where I've been buying them has 3 flavors per box and I prefer chocolate the most.  Whoever wrote the poor review about the high fat doesn't understand much about diet!  I've lost 20 pounds using these bars as a morning snack between meals combined with regular exercise and watching portion sizes.  Fat isn't the monster some think it is.. you need it and these bars provide a natural fat full of Omega 3 and Omega 6 along with a good mix of carbs and protein.  Thank you Lara Bar.
966,B0018KR8V0,A1O97JT8IXKMFK,"Jocelyn Neveaux ""psyche_knot""",5,"These are my favorite variety of Larabar.  If you like gingerbread (not gingersnaps or gingerbread cookies, mind you -- actual gingerbread, the kind that you can eat by the slice) than I am willing to bet that you will love these bars as much as I do.  The taste is exactly like that of freshly baked gingerbread; the texture is moist like gingerbread but crunchy because of the nuts the bar contains.  The crunchiness, in my opinion, doesn't detract a whit from the overall fabulousness of these bars -- in fact, I would say it adds to it.<br /><br />Finally (and this is true of all Larabars) the stunning brevity of the ingredient list bears noting.  Larabars contain no added sugar, no artificial flavoring or coloring, and no preservatives.  All of the sweetness and flavor (and there is just enough of the former and plenty of the latter) come from wholly natural, healthful sources."
967,B0018KR8V0,ATGD5QNAD6FAN,Elizabeth,5,"I'm new to Larabars.  I'm a bit of a junk-food junkie, and figured I should start trying to clean up my act by making healthier choices when snacking.  These are just fantastic!  They taste so good -- and not just good for health-food, but good, period -- and are really energizing.  I plan on trying out all the different varieties of Larabar."
968,B0018KR8V0,A21KH420DK0ICA,capemaychristy,5,"Started that ""whole 30"" diet which allows Larabars.  What a treat for the palate!  Tastes like a dessert - incredibly filling and satisfying.  Two and a half weeks into the diet and I've dropped 10 pounds.  I eat a Larabar every day.  100% fruit with no added sugar or chemicals.  My personal favorite is the Coconut cream pie."

I used to love Nature Valley bars, then I fell in love with the FiberOne bars, then I inhaled Balance bars. Now I think I've settled on Larabars, simply because they have such few ingredients and I can pronounce every single one of them. Even better, I can go to a regular grocery store and buy the ingredients, and if I'd want to spend more time in the kitchen, I could make them myself! (google for recipes, people really do make them themselves!)<br /><br />Love that Amazon sells them in bulk (they can get quite pricey, depending on which grocery store you go to).<br /><br />My favorite flavers are the Coconut Creme Pie, the Keylime Pie, the Carrot Cake, and the Cherry Pie.

985,B0018KR8V0,AX7TLYDU9O0I1,daveybobabey,1,"(NOTE: I purchased this box on July 8, 2012 -- not May 2012. Amazon must have used the date of a prior Larabar purchase.)<br /><br />I think Larabars are healthy; I've been eating them almost daily for years, but I like only a few flavors, and ginger snap is the best! But beware when they have a strange, sharp flavor (it tastes almost chemical to me)! This was the third box I have purchased that had this problem (out of about 8 boxes total). It always affects every bar in the box. I was able to get a refund for the first two boxes, but not this box from Amazon (I don't know why not), so I am going through the manufacturer (now General Mills), but it is not easy (I have to mail back all the wrappers I have).<br /><br />After finding mold on one of the bars, I had two of the bars tested by a food research company. I was told that the problem is the water content, the Aw, which was .717 on the moldy bar (from one lot) and .687 on the other bar (from a different lot), which tasted bad but had no visible mold (other bars in that box were later found to have mold as well). These bars still had more than 7 months before their expiration date.<br /><br />Here's a quote from the food researcher: ""Pathogens cannot survive below water activity (Aw) 0.86 so food borne illness is not a risk below this Aw. Between Aw 0.60 and 0.70 the microorganisms of concern are xerophilic molds and osmophilic yeasts...In summary, the Lara Bar labeled ""Bad"" had an Aw high enough to support growth of mold and yeast. The other Lara Bar sample also had fairly high Aw, high enough to support growth of mold & yeast. As a standard practice, we target an Aw of less than or equal to 0.60 for all shelf stable products (with pH >4.2) in order to avoid growth of all pathogens and spoilage organisms. All manufacturers should be targeting an Aw of &#8804;0.65 unless they are adding preservatives.""<br /><br />I don't know if I will give up on these bars yet, because when they do it right, they are really good!"
986,B0018KR8V0,A3OFS9BUH41GAW,Julie M,5,"These bars are great to have around for when you're running late and need something filling for breakfast.  They are also great to have in your purse or at work when you're surrounded by non-paleo options.  Our family likes these because they are sweet without being overpowering and filling.  The Cashew Cookie, Blueberry and Lemon bars are our favorite!  We can order them by the case through Amazon, and have them shipped to our door way cheaper than we can buy them in our grocery store. These alone pretty much pay for our Amazon Prime membership!"
987,B0018KR8V0,AG7KEPUA63X9P,Keri Jones,5,"I have been wanting to try Larabars for over a year. Finally today I picked up a box at Sam's club (the only place even remotely close to me that carries them), and I couldn't be more pleased. The bar I tried today was Apple Pie. The ingredients in the Apple Pie bar are dates, almonds, apples, walnuts, raisins and cinnamon. That's it. All natural, real food. I will say that it does not look enticing, or actually even at all appealing, and the texture leaves something to be desired...but it tastes wonderfully natural and gives a nice energy boost. It will be perfect for before/after/during workouts, but has enough calories that if I am too busy to eat a meal it will suffice. Does it taste like apple pie? Only slightly. But people who aren't accustomed to eating apple pie really won't mind, or may not even notice."
988,B0018KR8V0,A6UN2UTFAI7RM,SRL,5,"My kids LOVE Lara Bars. Apple pie is one of their favorites. It basically tastes like cinnamon. These are great for taking with us when we are out and about (I have 5 kids) and are much more healthy snack than almost anything else convenient. You can make them yourself easily but when you dont want to or cant, Lara bars are the perfect solution."

It looked like a candybar-shaped turd.<br /><br />But then I ate it, and the texture wasn't that great either so I was still grossed out with the image of the turd, but kept eating it. To my great relief it tasted really nice. There is a lot of flavor for how few of ingredients there are.<br /><br />Also, I really liked the minimalistic ingredient list. My advice, just don't look at it when you eat it."
990,B0018KR8V0,A2LLC1OGRHM7GK,Godsgirlfromdixie,5,These Lara bars are absolutely delicious!  A great healthful alternative to a candy bar.  The cookie dough flavor tastes much like real cookie dough without the harmful sugars and artificial flavorings.  Brownie flavor is excellent as well.

Larabars are sweet, but a lot of bars taste too sweet to me. Larabars are less sweet than some so someone who wants a really sweet snack might prefer something different, but I believe anyone who likes the taste of ginger would enjoy this bar. It tastes like ginger spice cake. I love it."

I admit your taste buds do have to adjust to the natural flavors, especially if you are use to other bars that have a lot of artificial ingredients.  The local Kroger's had these 10 for 10 and I have tried almost all the flavors. The apple pie, cashew cookie, and lemon are my favorites."
1002,B0018KR8V0,A3SZC0I95QULAS,Megan,5,"So these bars are made of real things, and most of those things are organic!  Or all, I can't remember.  I don't like over processed food, and so this bar is perfect.  It's DELICIOUS too, of course."

1005,B0018KR8V0,AS6SH2JM2YY3H,R Schmidt,4,"Well, if you are following the ""only eat processed foods with five ingredients or less"" rule, this product, Larabar's ""cherry pie"" fits the bill.  There are three ingredients: dates, almonds, and cherries.<br /><br />As a sports snack, it has 200 calories (70 from fat), 5g protein, and 5g fiber.  It's not a high protein bar for muscle building, but it does have the calories for glycogen replacement.<br /><br />It's not really crumbly or melty, so it transports well.  And if you are looking for a gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, vegan snack, this may be for you.  Most of us will snarf it down in about 4 bites.

After deciding on the Apple Pie flavor, I found one of the best tasting alternatives to breakfast I have ever eaten. Each bite is massive amounts of apple taste. The bars are well spread with nuts but the fruit taste is where it is at. The only downside is that the bars are kinda small so you will have to eat multiples."
1008,B0018KR8V0,AF1HWYCKEWM5M,"shaun mcneil ""Vampiresuck""",5,"These are delicious, thick almonds (*with skin, which for me tend to get stuck in my teeth, so fyi) and they have a nice spice kick to them without being to much.<br /><br />I'm an athlete who is constantly looking for easy on the go snacks and fats - these cover that little two hour window for when something comes up at the last minute - be it working late or driving across town for something, etc.<br /><br />I live in Dallas TX and these arrived in the middle of the summer when it was 110 degree's outside.  I grabbed one fresh out of the box so they were hot and I later found then to be better hot and soft than at room temp. I would suggest giving that a shot. (I leave them in the car after a break at work and let them heat up that way, I have never microwaved them - I would imagine that would ruin them)"
1009,B0018KR8V0,AWGWAOYYNJ069,Sarah Alli Brotherton,5,"I love Larabars- I like to keep one on me in case I get super hungry when I'm out and about because the protein and fat content makes them very filling. Because I'm gluten intolerant and also do not eat highly processed foods, it can be pretty difficult to find something to eat away from home, but when I get really hungry I get ill anyway. Larabars have saved my butt more times than I can count- I like the coconut cream and peanut butter chocolate chip ones the best and they have a little less fat too!<br />Plus, only a few ingredients. Perfection!"

The main reason I like these bars is that I don't get the allergic itch I get with some other health bars. If you have any food or nut allergies, you know what I'm referring to. So far so good!"

The nuts provide fibre and the "" good "" fats, whereas the dates are a great source for energy on the go.  I love the new flavours ( Peanut butter chocolate chip and the chocolate chip brownie).  My old favourite still is the coconut chocolate chew--I am a huge fan.  They are so much better than any old chocolate bar--in fact, chocolate bars not even in the ballpark as far as a comparison!"

Great snack or meal replacement bar.  I will be purchasing these again. My 10 year old daughter wants to eat them all the time and I give these to her before Softball games to give her the energy and nutrition she needs. This is a great natural nutritional bar with only a few ingredients, so you know they are healthy and they taste like quite a ""treat!"""

I wanted to find something I can bring along with me in my purse and when I travel that was easy and healthy. My personal trainer told me about Larabar and now I am hooked. Of all the flavors I love these best: Lemon, Cherry Pie, Chocolate Chip Brownie, Blueberry Muffin, and Banana Bread. Yum!"

This product enables me to have my ""sweets"" without the consequences.  It's substantial & if I have two, I end up skipping a meal. (Not recommended, I know.)  The consistency is slightly moist, compact, heavy; the flavor is not overly sweet, peanut butter-y and fun (it's the only way I can describe it) when you get the chocolate chip.  If the bars had any more chips, they would overpower it.  I only wish it was a wee bit larger.  Just a wee bit because I go through three to four boxes every month."

The yummy, scrumptious ingredients of dates, almonds, walnuts, raisins, pineapple, unsweetened coconut, carrots, cinnamon, and extra virgin olive oil all put together is heavenly.  This is one of my favorite flavors of Larabars.<br /><br />I can't sing enough praises for Larabars:  good taste, healthy, convenient.  It's good to have a few (or a lot) on hand in case you get a little hungry or weak.<br /><br />And, oh, I must mention:  These bars are created and made in Colorado.  I know, that has nothing to do with the goodness of these bars.  But Colorado is my new favorite state, so I mentioned it.  The goodness of these bars are just as wonderful as Colorado is beautiful.  And if you know how breathtaking Colorado is, then you know I am comparing these bars to something awesome.  Awesome, healthy, tasty bars that are convenient.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like these type of bars.<br /><br />Carrot cake highly recommended if you like carrot cake."

I am so tired of the bars that taste like sawdust, and am really tired of having to eat something dry and with oats if I want nutrition (mind you.. I actually like oats, but options are nice). I didn't consider myself a fan of dates, one of the main ingredients, but this is such a pleasent alternative that you will be serendipitously delighted."

No added sugar or salt!  They have only 3-5 ingredients each.  All raw (except the peanuts in the peanut butter flavors are roasted.) It is exciting to be able to have them in larger quantities at a significantly lower price.  Now we never run out!  I think I'm going to have to set them up on subscription to be automatically shipped monthly!  They arrive quickly and we take them everywhere and enjoy them.  Even my two year old loves them.  Perfect for when you are away from home or don't have time for a meal and don't want to consume something full of bad fats, sugar, and preservatives.  Three in our family are gluten intolerant.

I like the minimal ingredients used.(no chems)<br />I ate the Trio brand bars along side this one for comparison.<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because of personal preference. I like the more nutty, crunchy textures of the Trio brand.<br /><br />Overall, I think it was a good bar. Not high on cals pretty good on nutrients.<br />Looking for a good tasting vegan bar, this is a good one to try out."

I can't believe how great these ginger snaps are.  This is not meant to be a criticism but I must admit the look of the bar is not pretty but once you've taken a bite you'll know, they're pretty wonderful."

The all-natural raw foods approach makes for a great snack bar - not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner - but the lemon flavor here is definitely not subtle.  I still enjoyed the box, but prefer the cherry pie or banana cookie flavors."
1070,B0018KR8V0,A3DRA58AQJEIP8,"Blossomthyme ""Avid Amazonian""",5,"I read about the fat content on the Larabar site, which said: ""What about the fat in L&Auml;RABAR? Plant-based fats are healthier than animal fats. The fat in L&Auml;RABAR comes primarily from nuts-all plant-based fats containing Omega 3 & 6 essential fatty acids, which have been proven to reduce LDL cholesterol and help protect the heart.""  I read all the reviews before making this purchase and I was amazed at how misleading PEN PAL's, review was (they said: ""LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES!"").  It sounded scary.<br /><br />Olive oil is good for you, but no matter what, the calories from fat (9 calories per gram) are going to be the same whether it is from bad sources of fat or good sources.  The calories from this product are from good sources and that is what counts.  Everybody who has gotten to the point of good intelligence regarding managing their intake of food should be aware how to use good fats vs bad fats, good carbs vs bad carbs but this IS, in my estimation, a very healthy product and just as you would not put too much olive oil on your food, or overeat nuts, you won't binge on Larabars or anything else you know will have unwanted consequences.  I'd give these delicious bars a try and fit them into your food management routine any way you see fit!  It definitely goes in the good food category for sure.  Don't hate the fat, hate the lack of discipline and they are a tempting yummy. :)"

All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />I have now tried most of the Larabar flavours, and these are my favourite - very simple 2-ingredients, but they go great together.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar."
1072,B0018KR8V0,A2QR1ANNVHN3Q6,laura nisbet,5,"This bar is utterly delicious. Real ginger makes it spicy and crunchy and everything else makes it sweet, and the whole shebang is just so good for you.

1073,B0018KR8V0,A1ZL9M7IMJ246,S. Resch,5,"I am a food bar junkie. I found these at Whole Foods about 6 months ago, and eat them regularly. I still havent got tired of them. I basically eat them as a meal supplement. I look for bars that taste good, are low in saturated fat, high in fiber, high in protein, and low in things like corn syrup and sodium. The Larabar product meets all these criteria. They are kind of unusual in their consistency though whic hmay turn some people off. They are quite dense in consistency, and some flavors also have a ""sticky"" consistency. The flavors are potent fresh and generally good. They taste like they are really made of the ""flavor"" on the label. Cherry taste like an actual cherry. Banana tastes like actual banana, etc.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Larabar is the best Food bar product, followed by Clif Bar, followed by PowerBar Harvest."

I'll open a package a munch on a little bit at a time just to saver the taste.  So far, I've had the lemon, cherry, ginger snap, and a chocolate one and these.  I love every one except not a big fan of the chocolate one.  And usually chocolate anything is my favorite. I'm very glad I found these."
1075,B0018KR8V0,A30HHGQ1P5OXTZ,Stephanie Adams,5,"This is my new favorite Larabar. My only gripe is that it's hard finding the new flavor in stores. I love Larabars in general because of their amazing ability to weave a few simple ingredients into great-tasting, portable snacks. There's no strange chemicals added, just fruit and nuts. They're my go-to snack to keep in my bag for those times when gluten-free food is hard to find. And they're the most reasonably priced of their class.<br /><br />The PB&J flavor is great because it combines the tart bite of their Cherry Pie flavor with the richness of peanut butter. If you can get used to the idea of a PB&J sandwich in bar form, it really will remind you of the original.<br /><br />This flavor has only 4 ingredients, no added sugar (sweetened with dates) and a respectable 6g of protein (they range from 3-6g, I believe)."
1076,B0018KR8V0,A1SYLII0808HD6,M. Allen Greenbaum,5,"I've reviewed a lot of these products, and most have some common flaws: Bad, ""unnatural,"" or chemical-like taste (especially in the metallic after-taste), woefully stale, cardboard-like texture, high fat content, and relatively high price.<br /><br />Fortunately, Lara-Bars are perhaps the best tasting line of ""nutritional bars"" available. The apple pie version is nicely chewy, with a taste of rolled oats, cinnamon, raisin, and, of course, apple, though it's not as intense or satisfying a fruit flavor as their Cherry Pie bar.  The apple hits you especially in the aftertaste, which is very satisfying.  Perhaps a bit on the dry side, but neither boring or cloying, and without that awful artificial taste mentioned above.<br /><br />The ingredient list is all one needs to read to discover the ""secret"" of Lara's natural taste:<br />Dates, almonds, unsweetened apples, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon. That's it! This is absolutely unheard of in type of food! Go to any comparable product (e.g., Cliff, Balance, Promax, South Beach, etc.) and you will find a veritable mine of vitamin and mineral additives.  For that reason alone (OK, and the concomitant wonderfully natural taste), these stand leagues above the competition.<br /><br />Does this reliance on natural foods cost you in nutrition?  I don't know--that's one for doctors and dietitians. However, I can list the nutritional values here:<br /><br />In one bar, you ingest the following:<br /><br />One serving (45 grams) provides 180 Calories--90 of them from fat;  10 g, Total Fat, of which only 1 gram is saturated fat,  4 grams are monounsaturated, and 4.5 grams are polyunsaturated (no trans fat, although, interesting enough, those grams add only to 9.5);  NO Cholesterol; 5mg of Sodium: 280mg, Potassium; 23 grams, Total Carbohydrate. Of which 4 grams are fiber and 17 grams, sugar (all that fruit), and 4 grams of protein. IT also provides 1 gram of Omega-3 and 4 grams of Omega 6 fatty acids. The fruit content sums to 1 serving of fruit according to the USDA food guide pyramid (I'm reading all this off the wrapper).<br /><br />Vitamins: Vitamins A and C --0% (of the percent daily values, based on a 2,0000 calorie diet), Vitamin E -10%,  Calcium--6%, Iron--8%, Thiamin (B1) --4%, Riboflavin (B2)-8%, Niacin (B3)--4%, Vitamin B6--4% Folate--4%, Zinc--4%, Copper--15%, Magnesium--10%.<br /><br />Some additional information can be found at--where-else--larabar.com, a nice little website where interested foodies can read about the company philosophy. For those not so inclined to visit, I offer an excerpt:<br /><br />""Humm Foods, the creator of L&Auml;RABAR, firmly believes that the foundation of a healthy mind, body and spirit is derived from what you eat. And what you eat is healthiest and most satisfying when it's in a whole, natural state...<br /><br />HUMM FOODS [note: this is contrasted with ""junk foods""] ... resonate with energy in a whole, natural state. When consumed, they cause you to feel vibrant and alive when consumed, they cause you to feel vibrant and alive.<br /><br />You can expect an unmistakable urge to humm after every L&Auml;RABAR  you eat.<br /><br />Let the humming begin!""<br /><br />Writing like that tells me these people are--and I hate using this overused word--PASSIONATE about their product. Give it a try!"
1077,B0018KR8V0,A3Z8QK73YK2II,David Marinelli,5,"These bars are my favorite trail food. One makes a good breakfast. Two make a decent lunch while hiking. Not as sticky as Powerbars and Cliffbars, although I like those too.<br /><br />Others have commented that they are high in fat, calories and carbohydrates. What's wrong with that? These are not rice cakes, they are energy bars. The ingredients are: dates, almonds, unsweetened cherries. No added sugar. Non-gmo, gluten-, dairy- and soy-free. Vegan and kosher. No trans fat. One bar has only 3% of your recommended daily value of saturated fat. Healthier than lots of alternatives.<br /><br />Cherry and Lemon are great. Apple is almost as good. Pecan is just so-so. Haven't tried the other flavors yet.<br /><br />It's hard for me to believe that mold could grow on these because they are pretty dry.  Maybe it was crystalized sugar? My box from Amazon is labelled best by 12/2008, and they are all fine.<br /><br />I like these so much that I signed up for regular Amazon deliveries through Subscribe and Save.  Now I won't have to depend on Costco for a steady supply.  Keep up the good work, Humm Foods!"

1079,B0018KR8V0,AGEMBA62HZXU9,Jackie,5,"These bars are fantastic- I love how they are not overly sweet like every other bar I've tasted ie luna and cliff bars. I LOVE that- all I taste are gently sweet dried fruit and nuts, not sugary crap that gives me a tummy ache. All natural stuff. I think for many people with low ratings of this product regarding taste, that is their beef- ""no flavor"" when they are used to super sweet processed taste. These bars are great for people with any sort of intolerance for soy or gluten and make great snacks after a workout."

The Cherry Pie Larabar reminds me of the cherry pies my mother used to make.  They are not overly sweet (like the store-bought pies made these days) and the tart cherry flavor really comes through.  I must admit I had my doubts when I first opened the wrapper, because the Larabar did not look very appealing.  Don't let looks fool you...this bar is delicious!!<br /><br />I first purchased a variety of Larabars at a local store to try them out.  Once I found the Cherry Pie bars, I decided to purchase a whole box of them through Amazon to save money.  An unexpected bonus was that the bars I received through Amazon.com were much softer (and fresher) than those bought locally."

I especially appreciate that they are gluten free. I myself am not gluten free, but my MIL is, and it is hard to keep healthy snacks (other than fruit) in the house that are gluten free. The Cherry Pie flavor is our favorite!"

Yes Larabars come in a package, but they do not have any preservatives, chemicals, or ingredients whose names I cannot pronounce.  Each flavor has 4 or 5 ingredients.  It's refreshing to read a package label that you can pronounce, understand, and visualize each ingredient.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are Coconut (SO YUMMY), Lemon (tastes like a lemon square, very tart), and Banana (tastes freakishly like banana bread).<br /><br />These bars will satisfy your sweet tooth and keep you feeling full."

They contain no more than 6 ingredients such as walnuts, almonds and cashews to provide protein and the ""good fats"" as well as such fruits as dates, bananas, cherries and apple which give your body the carbohydrates it needs for energy. Compare them to any other bar on the market and you will see how the short list of simple ingredients adds up to great nutrition as well as great taste."

Besides being so yummy, I love the fact that it's RAW and therefore all the nutrition from the dates and cashews is kept intact.<br /><br />I always keep extra bars in my car or purse so that these tasty bars are always available to satisfy my hunger wherever I go.

1107,B0018KR8V0,A2LINNB0T986FU,Kathryn,5,"This is my favorite energy bar.  Most of the time I prefer to eat real food, but there are occasions (long hikes, motorcycle trips) when it is more convenient to stash a small energy bar that is not damaged by extreme temperatures or being squished, and does not need anything else for preparation or clean up.  I also will frequently throw one in my purse if I am going somewhere for the day like a fair or expo where I'm not sure if there will be anything to eat besides hot dogs and nachos.  I like that there are not any artificial flavors or colors, no ingredients I cannot pronounce or have to look up in a dictionary, and no preservatives.  This is my favorite flavor, followed closely by the lemon."

I had concerns last year and thought maybe the taste was ""off"" just on the one box.  So I picked up another box last week.  It's even WORSE!  Since General Mills bought LaraBars (Humm Foods) three years ago, the product just seems to have gone down hill.  It doesn't have the same fresh, alive taste; there is a harsh, metallic flavor that indicates whatever machinery produces the bar now is not being properly cleaned.  Also the bar didn't used to be so oily to the touch.  Oily, weird flavors in nut bars make me think the nuts have gone rancid.<br /><br />Since I am writing, I also want to say it has bugged me for years that AMAZON continues to misrepresent the maker of LaraBars in the title of the product ""LaraBar"" by ""LaraBar"".  I suppose this is because people who generally buy raw food product are not usually the same people who support multinational food conglomerates like General Mills.  But it just makes me think that Amazon thinks consumers are ignorant.  I feel insulted every time I see it."

1125,B0018KR8V0,A1R5Q4GXSYSKPH,Veronica,5,"It took me a long time to try these larabars out and I don't know what really prompted me to try one finally but I am so glad I did.  From the flavors that I have tried some just blew me away while some really left me feeling unsatisfied in the flavor department.  I will rate the ones out of 5 stars that I have tried, 1 being terrible and 5 being so delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cookie- 5 stars for this one, so delicious!!!  It tasted just like peanut butter cookie dough but made with crunchy peanut butter due to the nuts that are not ground up.  Such amazing texture and taste, it actually is better when left in the sun to warm up.  The flavor comes out so much better and texture too.  This has to be my favorite so far out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Pecan Pie- 5 stars for this one.  I am not a pie person at all, and pecan pie would never be my first choice but after having this larabar I am hooked on its flavor.  It tastes just like pecan pie, no kidding.  It's so strange how such simple ingredients can taste like the real thing.  It has a very deep flavor, almost a caramel molasses flavor.  There are nice pieces of pecans and almonds but not too many to overwhelm the bar itself.<br /><br />Peanut butter and jelly- 4 stars for this one.  It tastes just like that stuff called goober where there is peanut butter and jelly in the same jar.  I grew up eating that stuff and it's so much fun to be able to get that same flavor with this larabar.  I only gave it 4 stars though because it tends to get really tart due to that unsweetened cherries but still really delicious.<br /><br />Apple Pie- 2 stars for this one.  This was such a forgettable flavor, it was too tart in my opinion to taste like apple pie and they were really heavy on the cinnamon.  Don't get me wrong, I know that they are not suppose to really taste like the title says but it still is my least favorite out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Cherry Pie- 3.5 stars for this one.  This actually does taste like cherry pie but does taste like the filling of a cherry pie. I bet if they were to add cashews it would lend more of a buttery crust like taste but maybe not.  While this is a nice change every once in a while it is not one that I would get excited over.  Very tart but I love the ratio of nuts they used.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough- 0 stars, and yes I can give zero stars if I want.  This bar I took a bite out of and was so turned off by the taste.  Way way too sweet due to the chocolate chips used.  I love the larabars because of the no added sugar but by them adding chocolate chips which contain way too much sugar in my opinion really ruined this bar.  If it were not for the chocolate chips I think that it would have been better.  Unsweetened cocoa powder would have been better.  If you like almost candy bars but want a healthier option then you would like this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie- 5 stars for this bar.  This I was worried about trying because I am not really a fan of cashews to begin with but I want to try all of these bars, most of them anyways.  I was so surprised at how scrumptious this bar was.  It was not too sweet at all and the cashews lend such a wonderful almost buttery like flavor.  There is no added salt but I felt as though there was a nice saltiness to this bar.  This is my second most favorite after the peanut butter cookie larabar.  I like this one on days when I do not want any strong flavors and nothing too sweet and this one fits the bill.  I have never had a cashew cookie or heard of them but I can imagine they wouldn't be as good as this bar.<br /><br />I plan to try more so I will update this review soon."

It is so delicious. I share them with friends all the time and the only friend that didn't like it just had a thing about not liking dates (and the ONLY three ingredients in this bar-o-goodness are: almonds, dates, and unsweetened bananas). THANK YOU LARA FOR YOUR DELICIOUSNESS IN A BAR. Just as tasty as it is nutritious ... and THAT is somewhat difficulat to find in ""ready to eat"" foods."

I haven't tried a flavor I didn't like, but cherry pie is my favorite.  The ingredients are simple (dates, cherries, almonds), and they taste great.  I highly recommend these to anyone."
1137,B0018KR8V0,A1ORDEONT5RF23,S. Hill,5,"After a recommendation from my personal trainer, I tried Larabars for the first time.  She gave me a bar to try and I was hooked immediately.  I especially like the Cherry Pie flavor, but have also enjoyed all the other yummy flavors that I've sampled.  These bars are healthy, delicious,and ""habit-forming.""  What a convenient snack to carry!"
1138,B0018KR8V0,A3I24IB0CJEXGJ,Jonbz,5,These are some of my favorite bars and are not too sweet and don't melt in the heat.  I throw a few of these in my backpack and they're great anytime i need a quick snack.  These specific bars are a little tart from the cherries but i actually liked that.

They are worth the money!!.I like the fact that they don't contain soy..People think soy is really healthy but is has estrogen components that help you storage fat around your waist..  Anyways buy them!!"
1147,B0018KR8V0,A2LJJ4482V9LAW,SunnyBeachLife,1,I love many flavors of Larabars and like how they are raw and simple.  I bought one of this flavor to see if I wanted a box...no way.  You get the coconut that hits your taste buds first...then you are instantly smacked with an aftertaste of *SOAP*!  Terrible.  I tried 3 bites to see if it got better...NO.  I'd never recommend this although I do like other flavors.

So after hearing much about these, I decided to try them.  I tried various flavors, but still I just don't like them.  The texture is probably the worst part, I just find it gross and gummy.  As for taste, they're rather bland.  I think there are better tasting healthy options out there.  As for me, I won't be purchasing these again."

I think the cinnamon flavor is a little strong, but otherwise they taste like dates & nuts. That's great, if that's what you're going for. I'm a bigger fan of the lemon flavor ones. They have a good strong lemon flavor without being too sweet."
1153,B0018KR8V0,A1IYHYBC2WB8MI,J. Lomax,4,"We really like Lara Bars.  We originally purchased our first ones at Whole Foods, mainly because the ingredients list is very pure and simple.<br /><br />When you eat these bars, don't think fruit first, think nuts then fruit.  Then when you hit the chunk or bit of fruit its a nice suprise.  Don't get us wrong, these are great... but there is a marketing difference in ""Banana Cookie"" vs. ""Banana Nut Bread"" for instance.<br /><br />Definately worth picking up, especially at Amazon prices/shipping."
1154,B0018KR8V0,AJB5P7GVR0MT8,Harry the Horse,3,"""Cherry Pie"" is certainly a misnomer, even to those not used to traditional sweetness. Yes, the first ingredient in (all) Larabars is dates, and here it's very evident. Certainly a nutritious enough snack, but the cherries and almonds are pretty subtle and the flavor isn't top-notch.<br />Apple Pie is tasty and available on clearance from Target quite often.<br />Chococonut Chew tastes like chocolatey dates, as evidenced by the coconut as the final ingredient and dates as the first. Almonds overpower your mouth and the taste.<br />Cashew Cookie tastes just like a solidified version of my homemade cashew butter; would not invest in such a thing. Overly salty and bland, and a pretty hideous thing, too.<br />Pecan Pie is alright but certainly not a buy-twice.<br />Same w/ PB Cookie, which tasted more of peanuts than anything resembling a PB cookie.<br />PB & J<br />Coconut Cream Pie is atrocious, tasting like coconut oil and absolutely no cream component."
1155,B0018KR8V0,A1U00SSDK79VGQ,Jennifer C Baum,1,"My daughter is extremely sensitive to gluten so many products that promote themselves as gluten free prove to be otherwise when my daughter has a gluten reaction.  For the sake of keeping my daughter healthy I contact companies asking them if they test for gluten and if gluten is processed in the same facility.  If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated.  Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter.  They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not.  They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision.  Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer.  They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing.  They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels.  They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so.  So Larabar is attempting to deceive me.  They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars.  Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful.  I was so turned off by Larabar's response that I want nothing to do with them.  It was obvious they could care less about my daughter's health.  Ultimately, they put their profits above children's health."
1156,B0018KR8V0,A1I34N9LFOSCX7,Smeggy,3,"not as good as i expected from the ratings on here. they are not sweet at all & kind of too tart but has over 20 grams of sugar in 1 bar???  but they are made with raw, healthy ingredients so i will eat them. maybe i'll try another flavor next time."
1157,B0018KR8V0,AE7I3W9UA7VOW,Mommy O'2,1,"I really relied heavily on reviews on this one.  Unfortunately after receiving the bars I was sorely disappointed.  I like the RAWness of these bars but they don't taste like coconut, they don't taste like pecan pie.  They taste like a slightly tart pecan date nut log.  I LOVE pecans and dates but I like my dates sweet.  These aren't.  Too bad for me but hopefully I can help the next guy out. Great deal though for those of you that like these bars."
1158,B0018KR8V0,A124DJORUEYHNT,David Camp,2,"I'm not a fan. If you like dense and dry, like a pack of desicated Fig Newtons compressed into a single bar, then Larabars may be for you, but they're not for me."
1159,B0018KR8V0,AOP5TUC7TTEY0,J,2,You better like the taste of dates as that's all you taste with these bars.  No way this should be called apple pie.
1160,B0018KR8V0,A3G5E1FD1N51V1,B. Hambrick,1,"Horrendous texture and even worse taste!  Bar was waxy, dense and bland tasting with NO semblence of pecan pie flavor whatsoever.  My expectations were reasonable considering that this is a nutritional product rather than an actual slice of pecan pie, but it was so awful I had to throw it away after 2 bites, followed by a thorough rinse-and-spit session with a glass of cold water.  Blah!  Sorry Larabar,  I tried to like you..."
1161,B0018KR8V0,A2AFM9QVXAPOTG,mizsydney,1,I love Larabars.  I love pistachios.  Pistachio Larabars are awful.  horrid fruitcake taste and not enough pistachios.  back to cashew cookie and cherry pie.
1162,B0018KR8V0,AFT9Y4WLQVVDB,tayrorree,1,"I went hiking for two weeks and every morning we were provided with larabars in our breakfast bag. At first it seemed no that bad, but then we got the cinnamon roll flavor and I could not even get halfway through, it is just plain disgusting."
1163,B0018KR8V0,A3H8C6IFM68JB5,"Molly A. Dauster ""have history-will travel""",1,"As someone on a low sodium diet I have to make many types of food which most people buy, such as applesauce,bread, ricotta,and granola. I think these bars-and other Larabar flavors- taste 'chemical' to the point that they verge on artificial, despite being haled as all natural.  ""Natural"" does not equal tasty,and it often means nothing important. Besides tasting better,I wish the sodium levels were more readable - and lower.Sure fat,sugar and protein are all important,but more people die of cardiac disease and hypertension -linked to high sodium in the diet- than from lack of protein."
1164,B0018KR8V0,A1EYQFLURDOM3D,Love to Shop,1,"Why put unsweetened ingredients in one of these bars? Unsweetened chocolate? Disgusting. This product lacks flavor and is way too heavy and dense. I also don't know what could be nastier than unsweetened coconut. It needs to be lighter in texture and a lot sweeter (not cloyingly so) and then this might be at least tasty. As it is, it is a waste of money and an absolute disappointment.<br /><br />To the manufacturer: look for inspiration in the flourless chocolate cake sold at Trader Joe specifically for gluten free diets, and check out the flavorful almond horn by Aleia. Both are mildly sweet, but full of flavor.  The chocolate flavor pops in the mouth and makes you forget that it has no gluten in it.  The almond horn delights you with the fragrance before it ever hits your mouth.  Both go great with tea, coffee and fruit, particularly the cake goes well with fresh stawberries.<br /><br />Maybe you just need to stick to a core ingredient and work around it.  There is too much nastiness going on in this disgusting bar.<br /><br />This is a terrible product that cannot be recommended. There are just way too many nasty gluten free products on the market, and this should be placed exactly where I just put it, in the garbage. More $$ down the drain and continued disappointment reigns.<br /><br />I am being brutally honest because I was recently diagnosed with a gluten allergy and have exceedingly fond memories of all of the delicious wheat-based offerings I used to eat and I naturally expect to be able to partake delicious gluten-free substitutes, espcially since they usually cost twice as much as the products containing gluten. This is no substitute for the wheat-based version, to say the least."

1166,B0018KR8V0,A1HV6OJ88VJPB3,Sharon D'Amico,1,"I have been eating Larabar bars for years and love Pecan Pie bars. A few days ago I received a box from a warehouse in Kentucky. The box had oil spots on it and when I opened a bar, there was a strange odor, almost like fermentation. I ate it because I had no lunch with me at work, but now I have 15 more bars that I will not eat. I think the temperature at the warehouse was too hot. I've never had this problem before."

1171,B0018KR8V0,A2W3KOTHFGVNMT,SoylentGreen,1,"Everyone in my family shares my opinion that these things taste absolutely HORRIBLE.  I feel really bad for someone who needs to eat Gluten/Dairy/Soy-free or Vegan/Kosher foods.  If I had to live on these alone (and I don't), I'd convert back to being a non-vegan or whatever.  We all tried the Cherry Pie flavor, and what this thing has to do with cherry pies is way beyond me.  It's a lump of semi-solid goop with some nuts and dried fruits that taste sour and bitter and somewhat sticky.  Simply gross to the point I couldn't even finish one bar.  I may not be a health food nut, but I know what tastes like crap when I taste it...and these things are crap all the way. Steer clear.

1174,B0018KR8V0,A1V1LLQUE8A2NR,Pen Pal,1,"It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.)<br /><br />The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime).<br /><br />All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day.<br /><br />Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that.<br /><br />LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled ""healthy"" can be very bias.<br /><br />MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic.<br /><br />Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body."

I have spent years tinkering with different energy/meal bars and eventually settled with ClifBar--which is not bad, though it has many sugary ingredients like rice syrup, etc.  I was extremely excited to discover LaraBar, it is delicious, contains no added sugars and provides an excellent source of energy for training.  Definitely the best bar on the market!"
1176,B0018KR8V0,A3FHVLA1C3IIJG,Lex,5,"As a clean-eating vegan, I can't help but love everything about Larabars. Most of them taste great, and you can't beat an ingredient list this short. Of all the vegan flavors, I have to say the peanut cookie is the BEST. Ginger snap and apple pie are also great. The blueberry muffin is heinous, though. Steer clear of that one!"

I've never had luck with nutrition/meal replacement bars in the past (can we say cardboard?), so I was leery when those on the celiac support boards kept singing the praises of Larabars.<br /><br />I picked up my first one at Whole Foods, and was worried with the high nut content -- I'm not known to be fond of nuts.  but after one bite, I discovered I LOVE nuts -- if they are in a Larabar.  the cherry bars are sweet and sure at the same time, just like fresh cherries.  the dates and nuts balance out the flavor experience.<br /><br />unlike other bars, these are soft and tasty, and beyond filling!  I can usually only nibble half at a time.  but now, I have something to keep in my purse or in my desk at work for emergency food.  everyone else can have a sandwich with their wheat filled bread, and I'm perfectly happy to munch away on my Larabar."

Sometimes simple and natural is better, and this is one of those cases. I far prefer these to any of the fancy energy bars like Luna Bars, Clif Bars, etc. They are simply nuts and dried fruit, they satisfy my sweet tooth and also give me the energy I need to get through the day. I eat them as a mid-morning or mid-afternoon stack. Cherry Pie is by far the tastiest flavor.

WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />If you are a big chocolate lover, I would just warn you that these don't taste like a chocolate bar - the combination of cocoa and chili powder is really more like a Mole sauce you get in Mexican cooking - rich, but not at all sweet. And the chili powder is not enough to be hot or spicy.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar."

I wish that they would offer an organic version of this bar. However, they do taste amazing and are probably one of the best options out there if not the best. These are perfect for me at University for between classes when I am on the go and do not have enough time to go to the cafeteria quite yet.<br /><br />I would recommend trying the flavors before you buy a whole package, however if your willing to take a plunge, the top flavors I have tried so far have been Chocolate Coconut Chew, Coconut Cream Pie, Cinnamon Roll, and Cashew Cookie in that order. Some flavors such as Apple Pie, Cherry Pie, Key Lime Pie, I find can get old a lot faster and I would probably not go through a 16 box of them before I got somewhat sick of them.<br /><br />PROS<br />+Very tasty (LOVE the Chocolate Coconut Chew and the Cinnamon Roll).<br />+Simple ingredients.<br />+Whole food ingredients.<br />+Small, portable.<br />+Price is very reasonable.<br />+Filling.<br /><br />CONS<br />+No organic option.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />The price at Amazon is superb compared to elsewhere, you probably won't find anything in this price range at this quality, from what I have experienced. They are a good snack when you are on the go, perfect for a University student at that. Simple, whole food ingredients, the way it is meant to be. Definitely recommended. Will get a 5 star rating once they release an organic version!"
1188,B0018KR8V0,A23JC57DNBG8WV,G. Mellott,5,"These bars are not marketed as a diet aid.  They are organic raw food bars. Made mostly of fruit and nuts, Larabar products do not hide the fact that natural ingredients have calories and fat.  But can they be part of a healthy diet? Definitely. Taste is subjective - I myself happen to enjoy the flavor, but none of Larabar's products are going to taste like a Milky Way. When you're tempted to go for the really bad stuff, it's nice to have these around, but it helps if you like the taste of the natural ingredients."

If you like dates and nuts, you will like the pecan pie Larabar. If you think you are going to pretend you are enjoying pecan pie while eating healthy...I hope you have a good imagination. It tastes EXACTLY like dates and nuts because it IS dates and nuts. It's great if you like DATES and NUTS.<br />Don't be romanced by Illusions...and if you find that you are, remember..I TOLD YOU SO! Dates and nuts, dates and nuts, dates and nuts."

I have since purchased bars at Whole Foods and was so pleased to see them offered here.<br /><br />The Pecan Pie tastes so wonderful.  Just like a piece of pecan pie.  My<br /><br />favorites are the cinnamon roll and chocolate coconut.<br /><br />I read the other review regarding calories and fat, but these bars are healthy and so filling.  I have one for breakfast on the run, or as a mid<br /><br />afternoon snack.  With a plant based diet, I am not concerned about the calories and find the bars so satisfying. These are the best tasting bars I have ever tried.  It sounds like a commercial, but I honestly am in love with this product.  I have ordered 4 cases for our household.  My kids love them too and they are way better than the cookies and other sweet processed snacks offered for lunches."

These bars is for real!  I eat one while I drink my coffee every dang morning.  I eat one after I run (good carb:protein ratio, and lot's o'potassium).  Potassi... yum!  Some flavors aren't my favorite, so don't be judgin' if you've only tried one flavor.  Like apple.  Not that good.  I tend to like the nutty ones (I think that applies to women, too).  Pecan Pie, Peanut Butter Cookie, Pistacio.  Pistaci, yo!  And the Chocolate Coconut is good too- but don't expect it to taste like a chocolate bar from 7eleven because these bars is sweetened only by dates- they gots no added shoogs!  RE-SPEC!!  I buy in bulk."
1197,B0018KR8V0,A3S1YI6MC7832G,Reviewer,4,"I've grown to really like these bars, but the flavor names are a bit misleading.  I've had the apple pie, which is appropriately named, the jocalat(chocolate) I think will be disappointing to most in the beginning if you're really expecting true chocolate taste, but the actual flavor does grow on you, and the pecan pie is really delicious but it doesn't taste anything like pecan pie.  It's more like a very tasty, nutty, gooey date bar.  So if you don't get your hopes up with the flavors, I think you'll like them very much, AND they are truly wholesome and are perfect for the Paleo Diet."
1198,B0018KR8V0,A1P2XYD265YE21,"Andrea ""Readaholic""",5,"Peanut Butter and Jelly Larabars is a new flavor (to me, anyway, because I just discovered them in the stores here).  They are really awesome.<br /><br />I admit, I've never been a fan of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with light bread, but I LOVED peanut butter and jelly on graham crackers.  Now that I've gone vegan, I can't eat peanut butter and jelly or graham crackers, but this PB&J Larabar tastes just like the peanut butter and jelly on graham crackers that I used to eat.  And even for non-vegans, these bars are still good - anybody can eat them.  They taste just like whatever the flavor is, and are healthy (even though you'd never know it, because they taste so good!)<br /><br />These bars are healthy, natural, soy-free, vegan, kosher.  They have no added sugar, and no chemicals.  It is amazing how something so natural and simple can be so good.<br /><br />Larabars are good to pack for trips, lunches, or anytime you need some energy (or just food); they are convenient because you don't have to cook, measure, slice, or stir, and you don't need a container with a special lid.  You don't need anything!  You just open and eat!!!  All the flavors are good for energy or hunger-control, but when I am really hungry, my favorite flavors are peanut butter cookie and peanut butter and jelly (the featured flavor in this particular review).  The ones with peanut butter (not really peanut butter, but just peanuts) seem to give me more energy.<br /><br />I love all flavors of Larabars (I haven't yet discovered a flavor that I didn't like), but I do have my favorites, depending on the mood I'm in.  Like I mentioned in the prior paragraph, Peanut butter cookie and peanut butter and jelly are my favorites if I am really hungry.<br /><br />All the flavors of Larabars are healthy, and even though they have no added sugar, they certainly crave my desire for sweets (because they do taste like they have sugar, even though they don't).  I am not really a big ""sweets"" eater; I prefer salts.  If I could just have salty foods all the time, I think I could totally give up sweets.  But even those who do love sweets, I think these bars would satisfy their sweets desire, also, because they taste like whatever the flavor is."
1199,B0018KR8V0,ADGUQM6A5AJDJ,Observer,4,"The Peanut Butter and Jelly LARABAR is really, really good. The company struck gold with this one. If you are a fan of those sandwiches, you'll dig these as an on-the-go-snack. I just have a few minor gripes: one is that I like to ""stretch"" Larabars  (while still in the wrapper), because they're usually a little fat and brick-like and it makes them last longer/more fun to pick at, but when you smoosh this particular flavor out, it gets a quite crumbly (think pieces of peanut popping out); so, it's not as blended as other flavors. Also, it'd be nice if it were a bit saltier -- sometimes you just crave that, especially if it's a meal replacement and you're in a peanut-butter-and-jelly mood -- and a little protein-heavier. Finally, I really wish the entire Larabar line (not just Jocalat) was organic! That would really be awesome. But, these are nitpick-y things. You'll like this flavor -- a lot. In full disclosure, I haven't ordered them on Amazon, but I believe after eating my first one, I told whoever was in the room with me to please buy me a box of them because it was ""SO. GOOD."" So, go for it."
1200,B0018KR8V0,A29M5WQ364QNNV,sinep210X2,5,"These things are amazing. Healthy, instant, tasty, and pretty inexpensive at ~$1.50 per bar. They are free of dairy, gluten, meat, soy, etc and are raw, so almosy anyone can eat them.<br /><br />Now onto the flavor analysis. The first flavor I tried was Key Lime Pie. It was really, really good. Next I tried Cherry Pie. It wasn't as good, but with its strong flavor I found it to be the perfect companion to a few pieces of dark chocolate. When I had women over (I'm a young single bachelor) I'd share with them some dark chocolate and a cherry pie larabar and they would almost get as much enjoyment from that as they did from me. I just opened my new box of Lemon and it is easily my favorite flavor so far. Incredible, I don't want to risk trying another flavor because lemon is so good. My roommate preferred the lime but says the lemon is his second best.<br /><br />So to recap: these are good, buy them."

1204,B0018KR8V0,ANMA1H8LGEVBF,"KeithNYC ""KeithInNYC""",4,"I got these when Amazon was running a very good promotion, so it worked out to something like .60 a bar.  These have a really nice, tangy taste (the cherries) and a really satisfying chewy texture. I like that it's pretty natural and simple ingredients (grounds nuts, cherry, dates etc.), but for my preference, it's a bit too high in fat.  I like my energy bars to have no more than 3 grams of fat (or 4 max), while these have 8 (but then again, those lower fat bars don't taste as good as these).  ;-)<br /><br />I would try another flavor of these if there was another good sale and if I could get any that were lower in fat."
1205,B0018KR8V0,A3F1G6UH4Y39X2,"Linda G. Shelnutt ""Mystery Novelist""",5,"Ginger Snap is my favorite of the Larabars. For me it seems to provide the epitome of potency these bars have available.<br /><br />The combination of Ginger and Cloves with the nuts and dates, seems to give a cleansing, balancing, renewing, and empowering type of immediate, essential nourishment. I'm amazed at how fast this flavor will give me a solid physical strengthening when I'm lagging from having pushed too close to draining past ready reserves. After just a few luxuriously flavorful bites, I can feel an amazingly positive effect.<br /><br />What I noticed with tremendous relief, and a significant amount of awe upon first reading the wrapper on these bars was the basic, clear ingredients listing along one side, with the ""NO SOY, NO GMO"" noted on the other side. I had begun to believe that I'd never see a label which would give me that type of refreshing feeling of finally being able to eat something without fear of how much it would contribute to an already painful situation of serious health issues. To find that it would contribute instead to healing and strengthening had literally rekindled a lost concept.<br /><br />With the huge variety of simple, sane, satisfying flavor blends available in this line of tasty and true nutritional offerings, I enjoy asking myself what I most have a taste for at any moment when I need a solid [not pseudo with a skull-and-cross-bones price tag] energy lift. [I always carry at least 4 flavors in my purse.]<br /><br />I don't know what else to say except that I feel blessed, and that I tremendously appreciate what Lara has had the inner wisdom, creative versatility, and visceral fortitude to accomplish.<br /><br />Well done, Lady!<br /><br />Live long and prosper,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt"
1206,B0018KR8V0,AXLYU6GOOFFZ2,John,4,"These bars do taste great without being too sweet. A much healthier alternative than candy bars or the bars with added processed protein, but they are not 100% natural.<br />Although it is not listed in their ingredients, the bars do contain citric acid. It is probably added as a preservative by whoever supplies their dried fruit. It took me years to track down an eczema allergy to citric acid and these bars trigger it."
1207,B0018KR8V0,AABLG21GSR8S8,L. Liu,5,"Great Bar. Tastes like banana bread with only 3 ingredients. I've tried cashew cookie, and cherry pie, and even though they taste good, they don't need to match the taste of something as distinctive as banana bread. This bar amazingly tastes like banana bread without bread!<br />My boyfriend doesn't like dry bars, and this one is nice an moist. I took it snowboarding as a small snack and it doesn't get frozen solid. I plan on buying this flavor often."

1209,B0018KR8V0,AIM0EGF0UXWHY,Cristelle,5,"These kept me healthy through college - a GREAT studying snack, because the fruit and nuts both keep you energized and facilitate brain function (at least that's what my nutritionist friend told me). End result was I graduated engineering in 3.5 years with a great GPA! And I did not gain weight like most of my dorm buddies, even though I had very little time for exercise. Seriously - send your kid a pack of these instead of cookies or candy, they will thank you!<br /><br />My favorite bar was lemon - although I think that's a personal preference. Haven't tried all of them, but I mean too. My new husband and my father both need a health makeover (one needs to watch glycemic impact, the other needs to watch fat & sodium), but both love junk food, and so I'm going to try and get them into these too!"

1211,B0018KR8V0,ASFW4ZMNZJKDA,Mainiac,5,"I have been on a long quest for ""nutrition bars"" (or whatever you want to call them) that don't have refined sugar, aren't too sweet (however they're sweetened), don't have soy, and generally don't have extra crud in them. These are perfect!<br /><br />I like the flavor, and I like that the ingredients list is so short: ""dates, almonds, and cherries"". (200 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber. See larabar dot com for more.)<br /><br />They are a little bit gooier/processed than I was expecting... I had to check after a taste that there wasn't soy in there gluing everything together. But when I think about fruit leather that makes sense. In some ways, it's like a thick fruit leather with some larger bits of fruit and nuts.<br /><br />But I'm really glad to find them and will be trying more flavors. This is just the sort of bar I was hoping for.<br /><br />Update: My next favorite flavor so far is Chocolate Coconut Chew, which should not be mistaken for a candy bar-type snack, as I feared it might. It's not that sweet and not that chocolately. It's more substantial. Ingredients: ""Dates, almonds, walnuts, unsweetened cocoa powder, unsweetened coconut"". 240 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber... and I'm sorry I don't have the energy right now to type the rest. (Ah! But you can get it online if you put a dot com after larabar!)<br /><br />I also like Ginger Snap enough to have bought a box. They are, yes, a little cookie-ish (though with the same gooey consistency as the rest). I do love ginger, but I don't find myself reaching for this flavor and probably won't reorder. Ingredients: ""Dates, almonds, pecans, ginger, cinnamon, cloves"". 240 calories, 5g protein, 6g fiber.<br /><br />Other flavors I have tried (Note that I prefer less sweet things, although all of them have a dose of sweet)<br />  * Tropical Fruit Tart: I won't get this again; for me this was like a pina colada and not what I want in a food bar (partly, this means it was too sweet for me, but also all the desert-y flavors in that bar)<br />  * Peanut Butter and Jelly: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Cashew Cookie: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Lemon Bar: Too desert-y for me. Sweet and lemony.<br /><br />(Looking at the larabar web site, Peanut Butter Cookie has the most protein, with 7g, at 220 calories and with 4g fiber... I haven't been able to get that in my local stores yet, but that will be the next flavor I try.)<br /><br />Update 2: So I have bought a few flavors by the box now... but I'm realizing I wonder why these aren't cheaper here. They are 1.39 individually in my grocery store, and 1.27 a piece by the box at the current subscribe and save price of 20.28. So yes, that's a savings, but possibly not enough to buy in bulk."
1212,B0018KR8V0,AE4PE48Q2794I,"Tax Accountant ""Tax Accountant""",5,"These might be the best-tasting bars I've ever tried. They keep pretty well, too, although if you leave them in your car (in the heat) they will lose freshness will get hard quickly. They are great as a meal replacement when you don't have time for lunch and you need to grab something satisfying that won't spike your blood sugar and make you feel sick later on. This is a sustained energy-- I think it's the nuts that help it have a lasting energy feeling. The calories in these is always about 300, which is good for a meal replacement.<br /><br />I really love the ginger snap, which tastes just like a real gingersnap cookie and you can taste the real ginger. Although most Larabars are very delicious, and I can't say I have ever disliked any of them."
1213,B0018KR8V0,A3UK3RSNQP158O,J. Gamache,4,"I'm a fan of Larabars and the peanut ones are my second favorite.  All of them have only a few ingredients (less is better) and no preservatives or additives. Although I was quite surprised by the price of a box of 16, which pretty much equals over two bucks a bar.  My local grocery store sells them for one dollar, thirty-nine cents.  The health food store sells them for a dollar fifty-nine. That can mean a lot of savings."
1214,B0018KR8V0,AHQEJUMCMZGTB,athiker,5,"Obviously a lot of people like this bar, myself included, so I thought I'd review it a bit differently.  When I was searching for a healthier between meal afternoon snack I read a lot of reviews for a lot of products.  I wanted something with few ingredients, not ""fortified"" and with some nuts in it.  I settled on these Larabar Fruit & Nut Cherry Pie bars and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P504ZG"">Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry Living Food Bar</a>.  I love cherries and I love blueberries so they seemed like good choices.<br /><br />The stats of the bars are very similar, weight (both 1.7oz, not 1.8), calories, fat, sugars, etc.  The PURE has more protein at 6g vs 4g.  The Larabar has no sodium while the PURE has just a bit at 5mg.  The Larabar is thicker, the PURE bar is wider.  Visually the Larabar appears to have more nuts in it, which doesn't seem to jive with the protein stats.  The PURE bar has a grittier texture while chewing so maybe more of the nuts are finely ground.<br /><br />1st ingredient is dates for both followed by almonds and then cherries for the Larabar and followed by blueberries and various nuts, organic agave nectar, rice protein and lemon juice for the PURE bar.  One would think with the extra ingredients in the PURE bar they were added to tweak the flavor or give it a fresher taste, but the flavor of the Larabar is better than the PURE by a pretty good margin.  It has a much fresher and lively taste.  I have to say the PURE bar is a bit cardboardy tasting to me and has a drier mouth feel.  It is not bad, in fact my 2 youngest kids eat them readily, just not nearly as good as the Larabar.  I think the tartness of the cherries in the Larabar kick up the flavor vs the milder blueberry flavor of the PURE (maybe the lemon juice add as an attempt to kick up the PURE bar flavor and tartness?).  In fairness I should probably review the PURE Cherry Cashew bar but I much prefer almonds over cashews so don't plan on ordering any from Amazon.  If I stumble on the PURE cherry in a regular store I will give one a try thugh.  I still get both auto shipped from Amazon for variety sake, but am looking for a better tasting blueberry bar w/ basic ingredients including nuts.<br /><br />For grins here is a comparison of the Larabar, PURE, Snickers, Hershey's and Maruchan Chicken Ramen noodles in a few categories.  Stats are listed in the order I listed them in the previous sentence.<br /><br />Calories:  190, 190, 280, 210, 380<br />Total Fat:  8g, 9, 14, 13, 14  Saturated Fat:  0.5g, 1, 5, 8, 7<br />Sugars:  21g, 20, 30, 24, 0<br />Protein:  4g, 6, 4, 3, 10<br />Sodium:  0mg, 5, 140, 35, 1540 !!!"
1215,B0018KR8V0,A1P2XYD265YE21,"Andrea ""Readaholic""",5,"Cashew Cookie is my very favorite variety of all the Larabars!!!<br /><br />The reason I love it so much, is because it reminds me of shortbread.  I always loved shortbread, but do not eat it anymore due to the butter and eggs.  I need to find a good vegan recipe for shortbread, if there are any, but this cashew cookie bar is perfect.<br /><br />With my shortbread cookies, I prefer tea.  Therefore, with my Larabar Cashew Cookies, I prefer tea.<br /><br />I love both coffee and tea, but with shortbread, I feel tea is what goes best.  There are certain things that just go together.  Such as cornbread and iced tea; flatbread pizza and bubbly fruit juice; cold weather and coffee; hot weather and watermelon; friends and cozy lunch diners; shortbread and tea.  And in this case, it is Larabar Cashew Cookie and Tea.<br /><br />These bars come in different awesome and amazing flavors.<br /><br />These bars are healthy.  They are vegan-friendly.  There are no bad ingredients, such as sugar, chemicals, or preservatives.  There isn't even flour.  There are only healthy ingredients in these bars: fruits and nuts.  The fruit sweetens them.

They taste as yummy as your grannie's Coconut Cream pie did with none of the guilt. The taste is sweet but not overwhelmingly so. The coconut flavor is prominent and will delight your tastebuds. I highly recommend the Larabar Coconut Cream Pie bars for a bit of sweetness that is actually good for you.

These are a great pick me up that is terrific to have handy when a meeting or function goes long, or to keep me out of the drive thru on the way home from the beach or a road trip. They are high in carbs, but I don't eat them all the time. They are simple, with few ingredients, and are minimally processed. I feel good after eating them, and it doesn't feel like I just swallowed a brick, or that I have to wash it down with two gallons of water. On long bike rides or races they are perfect for balancing nutritional intake. Triathletes take note!"

1223,B0018KR8V0,A1PHT05SMGHSU5,GJ,5,"These bars have a strong cherry taste, but because they have no sugar, they don't really taste like cherry pie. The bars have only three ingredients: dates, almonds, and unsweetened cherries. The almonds are chopped pretty finely, but still give the bar a bit of crunchiness. I love the taste, but if you're looking for something sweet, you might be disappointed. Each bar has 190 calories and 80 of them are from fat."
1224,B0018KR8V0,AD24OMGURWPTN,Coffee Addict,4,This bar is good. It tastes like eating a banana mixed in with some nuts. I like that it doesn't have any sugar added and it just uses the natural sugars from the banana to flavor the bar.

No high fructose corn syrup, or weird chemical additives derived from petrol products, and definately nothing synthetic!  Nature at it's finest!  If you have kids, they will adore these and won't even know THEY ARE HEALTHY FOR THEM!  I have yet to meet a flavor that I don't like!  Anyone who gives these a bad review either haven't tried them or they wanted them to be a Snickers bar. (I still feel these kick the pants off ALL candybars-but that's just my humble opinion.)"

The lemon is my current favorite, but I have tried several of the others and find them equally satisfying.<br />These food bars are low in calories, high in nutrition, handy snack size and perfect for any folks with certain dietary limitations. Unfortunately,I have many food allergies found in MOST of the commercial snacks on the market, so these are very welcome to me.<br />Check the ingredient panel and be pleasantly surprised!"

They are a huge hit with my mom (the health nut) and my sister, who like me, is a college student. I love the ingredients list on every larabar ... only fruits, nuts, and sometimes a few spices, and more importantly, no corn syrups, sugar, synthetic fats, etc. I highly recommend this product for anyone who needs a nutritious snack, a balanced meal replacement, or brain food during a study break."
1229,B0018KR8V0,A1XOJ4J5PW3TBL,"E. Stark ""VeggieGirl""",5,"After just one bite, I was completely sold on this bar - it is PACKED with pieces of pistachios and cashews, has a sweet (but definitely not overly sweet) flavor from the dates, and has a nice, chewy texture. Overall, a very pleasing experience for my taste buds - all while nourishing my body, as well!<br /><br />Do not let some of the nutritional information (i.e. the fat and sugar contents) scare you - pistachios are an excellent source of protein, Vitamin E, potassium, magnesium, iron, phosphorous, and zinc; the cashews contribute iron and zinc as well, plus heart-healthy oils and Vitamin B6. In addition, the dates are a good source of Vitamins A, C, and B-Complex, plus iron and and magnesium as well. Even though the bar is only 51 grams, it is VERY satisfying and filling.<br /><br />Everything in this bar occurs naturally - no chemicals, artificial ingredients, or trans-fats here! In fact, the bar contains just three ingredients: dates, pistachios, and cashews - no dictionary needed to figure out its contents, that's for sure.<br /><br />When I received my package of the Pistachio Larabars from Amazon, the box was in great condition, and none of the bars (at least, the ones I have eaten so far; and I eat one almost everyday) have been rancid. Overall, this product (and other Larabar flavors, as well) is HIGHLY recommended, on my part."

The flavors i have liked the best, of the ones i have tired, are cashew cookie, cinnamon roll, apple pie, and gingersnap."

These bars are wonderful for people like me who are active and can't always squeeze in regular meals. I have tried to get as much raw food in my diet as possible and these really help.<br /> As for the calories, I see a lot of people commenting on this. As a dancer I am required to keep my weight down and so I know a thing or two about calories but these are not that high in calories if eaten as a meal replacement or a high energy snack in the afternoon. Remember these are made with a lot of nuts which are full of good fat, protein, and low on the glycemic index. Cherry and Lemon are my favorite flavors. Yum!"

Cocoa Mole' is such a great flavor- nice and chocolatey with a kick of chili pepper- works great as a mid-morning snack!  I like almost all the other Larabar flavors- except the banana which is kind of bland.  Can hardly wait to try the Key Lime Pie and the Pistachio flavors.  I wish these bars were sold in regular grocery stores, it's a long drive to Wild Oats from where I live..."

As far as nutrition bars, these are just about the only ones I'll eat because they are raw with whole, unprocessed ingredients.  I generally just have a great feeling after eating them.  Not like the other ""rock-in-my-stomach"" bars that taste artificial.  I highly recommend ANY Larabar!!!"
1241,B0018KR8V0,A1Y8IUMN7TBKS,Groovy Vegan,5,"If you squish together dates & bananas, mix in finely chopped almonds, form into bars, and dry the bars a bit so they're not too sticky, you basically have a Banana Cookie LaraBar.  I think they taste quite good for packaged bars and are healthier than most of the available food bars.  They taste like, well, bananas, dates, and almonds, with the almonds providing a bit of crunch.<br /><br />Although the ingredient list is only three words long, the wrapper text extolling the healthfulness and near-magical virtues of the bar is seven lines long.  To partially quote, ""Real food, raw food... No chemicals, no fillers, no medicinal tasting supplements.  LaraBar is never cooked.  Never Processed...[will] leave you with a pleasing sense of vitality and well being for hours to come.""  And there's more information on the wrapper, ""uncooked * unprocessed * no added sugar * non-GMO * gluten free * dairy free * soy free * vegan * kosher.""  The LaraBar website also tells you (in case you haven't figured this out) non-irradiated, no sulfites, and no colorings.<br /><br />All this is well and good, but if they're going to the trouble of making a bar that's so fabulously healthy for you, then it would be nice if they used organic ingredients.  Eating a bar made with conventionally grown (pesticided) fruit invalidates some of the healthfulness of the bar.  The bar tastes good, but in terms of healthfulness, I think LaraBar can do better.<br /><br />P.S. And what's with the two dots above the first letter A in Lara?  Do they want us to think it's an exotically Scandinavian product?  Like Haagen Daz, Lara bars are made in the U.S.A."
1242,B0018KR8V0,A2W1BKJ5IDQ1HZ,Ashley,1,"I've gotten this flavor larabar from the grocery store and loved it. In fact, that was the reason why I purchased it from Amazon - because the cost per unit is so much lower. The peanut butter cookie bar from the grocery store was moist and delicious. The bars I received from Amazon taste stale. They're dry and crumbly. The expiration date is not until 2013 so I don't understand why they would be this way but they are. I won't be reordering any more Larabars from Amazon!"
1243,B0018KR8V0,A1A0XDF14VAAU7,Just my 2 cents,1,"Yuck!  Moldy. For the price, they should be mold free. I ate one before I noticed the mold, and it tasted good, but GROSS!  MOLD!"

I also shared them with my family and friends which got me varying opinions.  There was only one person that complained it was too sweet. Other health conscious, ingredient readers were impressed with the make and taste.  For myself, I thought they were OK. I don't normally snack on fruit bars like this so it took a bit to get accustomed to the sticky and ""oily"" fruit bar.<br /><br />As I was coming to the last couple bars in my Key Lime Pie, I ventured to get the Coconut Pie. Oddly, they almost tasted the same except for a slightly stronger coconut taste. It still had the ""core"" of dates and nuts,etc.  What really jumped at me is on my 2nd to last Key Lime Pie ... I noticed fuzzy edge on the bar.  The box stated it hasn't expired either so I am hoping this is a single bad bar in the box.  However it doesn't help that to search the term on the comments here that someone had a whole box of *bad*.  I'll see how the coconut pie fares but the mental image is now stuck on me. It is an OK alternative but I may seek another late afternoon snack."

Its so bad- it tastes actually rancid-- It dosn't act  or taste like real Shilajit either-- real shilajit bunches up together -its first comes in a rock form- and if you grind up that rock it will be a powder- but it will come back together in a solid mass form once again after it has been powdered-- even if you buy capsules of it -if you open the caps you will find it has become solid- this so-called Shilajit is like rancid old flour- with some very bitter thing  added-- IT gave my son a headache!

1255,B005T697MC,A1Z8YX4WOIFU6Q,Lynn Bashaw,2,"I have found that the Healthy Choice soups are not a good soup for the microwave.  Of all I tried this one is the best, it only explodes or jumps around a little bit, and usually no mess results if you wrap the container in paper towels.  Something in the Healthy Choice soup or in the container design causes the soup to explode (top flies off and soup everywhere) or causes the container to jump around like a Mexican jumping bean, many times landing on it's side and draining cold soup throughout the microwave. I have tried in different brands of microwave and experienced the same issues.  I place container on paper plate, and cover container with many sheets of paper towel.  Sometimes this contains the mess, but often the force of the explosion will throw paper towels to the side and the eruption coats the inside of the microwave.  This rice based soup recipe does not seem to have as severe of a problem as some of the other recipes I have tried."

By the way....the issue of little tips/caps. One reviewer said to try vacuum caps. I went to the local auto parts store and didn't find any that fit, and at a cost of $8 for 5, I think not.

He tolerated it, but he clearly didn't relish it. He only ate it because that was all I gave him. Plus, I started hearing through the grapevine of cat owners that there were better products out there for urinary tract health.<br /><br />So, I asked my vet, and he recommended a high-end urinary tract health food that I decided to try, and my cat loved it.

1281,B002ABVKQA,A1BB63Q3ABADMR,Charlene Tercovich,1,"I purchased the Kona Joe ""Peaberry "" coffee in late December, 2009 as a Christmas gift for my husband who loves Peaberry coffee from Kona.  Upon opening the sealed bag of ""Peaberry"", the fragrance was stale, flat, and didn't smell fresh or anything like ""Peaberry"".  We brewed a pot of it and found it to be both stale and bitter in flavor.  It was so bad we didn't want to even finish the cup.  The inner sealed bag of this ""Peaberry"" coffee was UNLABELED???  The outer cloth bag which was removable was marked ""Peaberry"".  Were we given another coffee instead of what we ordered? We have not brewed any more of this awful stale, bitter coffee since.<br /><br />Very Disappointed"
1282,B0087GH4US,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,Joanna Daneman,5,"I have a Keurig in the office for guests (and myself) but I learned that most of my guests prefer a lighter roast than I do. After tasting the Veranda Blend, I found it was light, but very aromatic and you could still add sugar and cream and it was very similar to a good restaurant coffee. So when supplying choices of blends for guests, I'm including Veranda as a milder blend for those who don't like French Roast or Sumatra or other bold blends. I find that there is a bit of woodiness, but also a slight flavor of nuts and cocoa. It's a pleasant blend of coffee and a very good cup if you don't want something awfully strong. Some lighter roasts are acid to me, but this one seems to be balanced."
1283,B0087GH4US,A10TTBG5C6J091,Richard,5,I was so hoping that Starbucks would come out with a mild blend for k cups. Starbucks has exceeded my hopes. This coffee is delicious. THANKS STARBUCKS
1284,B0087GH4US,A186ZAYP2L4CDZ,"Nancy ""Stepfordmomto2""",5,"After trying this new roast at the store and loving it, I was thrilled when I was offered a free sample of the k-cups to try on my office machine.<br /><br />Same as the store brew, mellow taste (to me that means no burnt after taste) and a high caffeine hit.  I am not a coffee aficionado so I cannot tell you about the cocoa or toasted nutty flavors that they tout.  What I can say, is that if you are looking for a simple blend that will give you the morning or afternoon kick that you need without leaving an acid stomach burn, try this coffee.<br /><br />Yes, it is expensive as compared to brewing your own coffee from store bought beans in your Mr. Coffee, but that is the point.  You are brewing a fresh cup in the comfort of your own home without having to get out of your fuzzy slippers or in some cases, brushing your teeth.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a luxury and stop complaining."
1285,B0087GH4US,A1HGXLP6WATS4B,"F. D. Gillett ""Comparison Shopper""",4,"Brewed on the 10 oz. setting on my Keurig Platinum brewer, the first thing I noticed was the very nice, enticing aroma.  Could this possibly be the perfect K-cup?  I had to have a sip before I even sat down.  In that first sip I tasted some strength, some choclate and nutty overtones, followed by a smoothness I don't typically find in a Starbucks blend.<br /><br />For  the most part I don't drink Starbucks for several reasons.  First and foremost, they tend to over roast their beans and the result is an overly strong and somewhat bitter brew.  This Veranda Blend ""Blond"" brew isn't roasted so darkly and finally I can taste the real flavors in the coffee.  This coffee actually reminds me of what a good ""Donut Shop"" coffee used to taste like; before everything became darkly roasted.  But I stray...  The first sip as I said was very inviting with lots of interesting flavors and a lively yet balanced acidity.  As the coffee cooled in my cup the flavor changed a little.  It became more woodsy and earthy but with a bit more acidity.  Still a good cup that comes close to my favorite K-cup, Millstone's Fog Lifter.  Foglifter is a blend of both dark and light roasts in which the flavor doesn't change as the cup cools, the first sip is as good as the last.  The acidity is always balanced whereas with this Veranda Blend the acidity becomes slightly more pronouncd.<br /><br />I usually prefer a light to medium roast in the morning and throughout the day.  In the evening I like to relax with a darker roast or better yet with a real espresso (which sadly cannot be made in a Keurig).  My verdict for the Veranda Roast is that it will fill the bill for my everyday coffee if and when the Millstone Foglifter either isn't available at a reasonable price or is out of stock.<br /><br />The price you pay for this good Veranda Roast is, well, the price, and this is my reason for the deduction of a star.  Starbucks has long been priced higher than other coffees and the Veranda is no exception.  This is only a 16-count box which means we're paying right at a dollar a cup.  At the Keurig website I can buy Foglifter for around sixty-two cents per cup when it is in stock.  Am I being cheap?  Maybe.  I just don't find Starbucks to be worth the extra money just to have the brand name."
1286,B0087GH4US,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,"C. F. Hill ""CFH""",4,"This Starbucks ""Veranda Blend Blonde"" K-Cup makes a nicely smooth cup of coffee that tastes every bit as good as the in-store brew.

1287,B0087GH4US,A2JQ2CYHJDD2XJ,DocO,2,"Starbucks must think their coffee is made of gold.  A much higher price, and only 16 in a box.  While I agree with most others here, the taste is very good, but not worth the money.  If you want Starbucks Blonde, buy a bag and get one of the ecobrew cups and make it that way.<br />Update:  I went and kept track of the number of cups I could get from a bag, and you can easily get 25 cups from one bag which costs about half of what these k-cups do.

What I can tell you is about the packaging for the 54-count package and my experience with K-Cups, in general.<br /><br />If you opt to go with the higher count package, please note that it does *not* come in retail box packaging.  Sure, the K-Cups are the same but, you get a brown box versus several 'retail' packages.  This, to me, isn't a big deal in the least.  It's not a large box and I'd rather recycle one box than several smaller ones.  My point - if this is an issue to you, buy in a different quantity.  Secondly, the K-Cup patent is a great one but, unfortunately for Keurig, it's days are numbered.  While I've tried to grind my own beans and use a ECOBREW reusable K-Cup filter to get the same results as the Veranda Blend K-Cup, I've been unsuccessful in getting it 'how I want it'.  As such, I've continued to pay a higher price per cup of coffee but, in the end, I still think it to be worth it -- it's a very unique blend.  What I can assure you is that the prices per cup will likely fall off upon the expiration of the K-Cup patent.  For that, I'll keep my wallet handy for these until they hopefully fall off in price due to competition in the near future.<br /><br />A+ service by Amazon, as usual, with PRIME!"

For people who don't enjoy coffee. And of course, WAY over priced. Why is starbux almost 5 dollars more than all the other brands? In this economy? Guess he really needs the cash to fund more illegal settlements. The weakest coffee I've ever had. Horrible.<br /><br />Whats more? Theres a starbax on a corner not far from my house (go figure)...and it's amusing to see the lemmings line up around the building to pay $5 for a cup of coffee, when 3 blocks over is a small mom & pop Cuban grocery (family owned) that makes the best Cuban coffee this side of the everglades, made fresh to order. Not a soul in the parking lot, I jump out ask for a grande con leche with sugar. It's 16Oz. for $1, and not a penny goes to fund any illegal settlements in Palestine."
1305,B008RWB8MW,A2PN55MTK1BIL5,penny13,5,"These Elk Splits are the perfect chew for any dog. They have no discernible odor to humans, yet my dog knew exactly what to do with it. Unlike commercially sold bones, this has no grease to mess up carpets or flooring. It does not splinter, so it is good for small or large dogs. These come not split for larger dogs, but I have found that the split antlers are best for my 20 pound puppy. He got his first split antler when he was only 5 pounds, and knew what to do with it, and loved it. Helped through the teething stage. Bought one for every room, and when he went after something, or me, to chew on, I would distract him with his antler. It worked! These are supposedly humanely ""found"" as deer and elk shed their antlers every year. I hope this is true, as you can't believe everything you read on the internet, but it does make sense! As they can make money doing nothing but finding cutting, and bagging these to sell. They aren't cheap, but they do last a long time. After the marrow has been chewed out, the antler can still be gnawed on, and will harmlessly flake off, and like bone, can be eaten. When the antler gets smaller, it should be replaced with a new one, as it could be swallowed whole in a smaller size. These have lasted for weeks! So the expense in my mind is well worth it. They do sell it by the weight of the dog, but use your common sense. A smaller one is not going to be any softer, than a larger one. The larger one will last longer than a smaller one, as long as it is not so large that the dog can't pick it up and carry it around. Hope these are around for a very long time."

You'll want to remember, however, that ""low-fat"" does NOT mean ""low-calorie"" -- a single 2/3 cup serving has 230 of them, higher than just about any boxed cereal I have in my cabinet.

I drink at least 6-10 cups of tea a day and alternate between Typhoo and Yorkshire Red.  They both take cream & sweetener well without any loss of flavor.  The two are different but in good ways.  I always try other black teas as well but am never without Typhoo & Yorkshire.  In England you can find them in any corner grocery (like Lipton here) and they are not at all expensive. If you love black tea, Typhoo will not disappoint you!"

I like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those unrecognizable ingredients created in a science laboratory.<br /><br />The treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them.<br /><br /> On the package:<br />Use within 3 weeks of opening.<br />100% satisfaction guaranteed<br />Keep this bag out of the reach of pets and children."
1347,B008PDBRXS,A3HPCRD9RX351S,Spudman,4,"At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  ""real""beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.<br /><br />Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee."

I have been drinking teas from Assam, India for many years and find this to be one of the richest and smoothest teas I have ever tasted. I normally prefer loose tea but the Tea India company doesn't use bags that become over-bloated with water, as do so many tea companies. The Tea India bags are generous enough in size so that the leaves have room to turn over and porous enough so that water can circulate through the leaves, allowing them to release their full flavor. Sorry Twinings Irish Breakfast and all of Barry's wonderful dark teas, you're going to have to move to the back of the cabinet as soon as my order from Tea India arrives."

The paper sachettes do not break or spill out and retain the strong flavor till the last. Try adding some 4/5 tbsp of boiled milk and spoon of brown sugar for best results. Enjoy!!"
1414,B001ET5Y5C,AR8CRZO5GHHPU,A. Chauhan,1,I usually drink Brooke Bond Taj Mahal and I decided to try it since it was on sale at the local Indian grocery store. My mistake. It has an oily smell and the taste is flat. Never buying this again. I drank about 20 bags and then couldn't take anymore. Tossed the lot.
1415,B001ET5Y5C,AEQ74063ZPPAW,Walker,1,"First of all, this was a LOT of tea.  Two large boxes (each over 10"" x 6"" x 4"") that contain a ton of tea bags, each round and filled with a generous amount of tea.  The boxes weigh about 28 ounces each, more than listed.  That's 3 and a half pounds of tea.  And the steeped tea is a nice rich orange color.  And, with regret, I just threw out one unopened box and and the remaining 2/3 of the bags of the other.<br /><br />Why?  Because although the tea starts out tasting rich and good, it turns foul and bitter after several minutes.  At least it does when mixed with moderate amounts of sugar and fresh milk.<br /><br />Although Orange Pekoe refers to a GRADE of tea, having to do with the size of the broken up leaf particles, in North America it is generally thought to refer to the COLOR.  Orange color in tea is a result of oxidation of the tea.  And this tea must be really oxidized, because it does have a rich orange color that appears remarkably quickly, after steeping for as little as 45 seconds.  I've never run across a tea that steeped more quickly.  In an effort to avoid the bitterness that develops, I tried quicker and quicker steeps, and even experimented with cooler water.  But nothing helped.  If steeped too quickly, it just tasted thin and yucky.  I guess there is such a thing as TOO oxidized.<br /><br />Too bad, because the initial taste is good and you sure get a lot of tea.  But unless you drink a full cup in about two minutes, you won't like the taste that develops."

I tried one and was hooked.  They are really delicious.  I ended up keeping half the box for myself.  My husband loved them too."

Being a black licorice fanatic, that is totally unacceptable!  I emailed them and was told a replacement box was on its way.  Waited over a week and still no replacement.  Emailed them again and inquired as to status and wanted a response....where is replacement and finally if not sent give me a refund.  Finally after no response, Amazon refunded my money.  I usually buy my licorice pipes locally but decided to order thru this company due to it's good rating.  However, I would not recommend them after my experience -- two weeks to not receive my licorice and then have to go buy it locally anyway.  Next time I will save myself the inconvenience and frustration and just go buy it locally....at least I know it will be fresh and not a stale, hard handy that has been sitting on a shelf for who knows how long, plus poor customer service.

These cookies... not so much. The brownies are so rich and chocolatey that I raced back to amazon and ordered these cookies. There aren't many chips and the ones that are there look like chocolate chips but they don'r taste like them. I gave it 3 stars because this does make an easy base for gluten/dairy free cookies, just add more of your own dairy free choc chips. The choc in the brownies is the premium Ghiradelli chocolate, so Bob... make the chips in these cookies out of the Ghiradelli too and you'd really have something."
1427,B000EDBQ4M,A2E06BWD0AH43W,Lynn S,5,"I was told to minimize my gluten intake, so I bought this cookie mix but with very low expectations for how they would taste.  They are YUMMY though!  The mix calls for margarine, but I used butter.  The next time I make them I might add in some more mini chips, but they really are delicious as is.  I think they were even better the day after I made them -- they have a rich texture which was almost like a peanut butter cookie.  I think even people who don't restrict their wheat/gluten intake would really like these."
1428,B000EDBQ4M,A15BG6MMEQXBV7,B. Graves,5,"Instead of following the recipe exactly, I used 1 1/2 cups of softened butter (instead of 1 cup of margerine), 2 eggs, and added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Mix, spoon, and bake for 12 minutes; makes about 2 dozen.  I am very picky about baked goods, especially since I am only recently gluten-free, but I must admit, these are wonderful!  I'll definitely be indulging in these again and again!"
1429,B000EDBQ4M,A1MW3RFJI8SEJR,"Stacy ""cheetaah""",1,"So, I made these cookies a few weeks ago and they were really good.  In fact, I got an upset stomach from eating so much dough and only ended up with a few fabulous cookies.  So I bought some more.  I smelled the beans as soon as I opened the package, that beaney smell that some GF flours have, and while I didn't remember that from last time I figured it would go away when mixed and cooked.  So I mixed in the rest of the ingredients, and the smell got a bit worse, and the texture seemed all wrong.  I tasted the dough (you must be thinking that I'm an idiot by now doing this, but I really wanted some cookies to go with today's snowstorm!), and YUCK.  5 minutes later I still have a bad, metallic taste in my mouth.  Seriously, like these are contaminated with metals or something.  I am going to throw away the cookies that are baking.  They look all wrong... like meringue, not like chocolate chip cookies, nothing like the batch two weeks ago.  It's really weird.  Two completely different experiences with the same product in less than a month.  This batch of cookies is a failure of 4 of 5 senses: smell, sight, taste, and texture.  I'm glad I can't hear cookies.  There are some serious quality control issues here, that are probably the root of the range of opinions in these ratings.  I think I need to contact Bob.  Too bad for him I didn't review this product two weeks ago."

At first pass, I was not impressed with these at all... I personally like a very chewy chocolate-y cookie and this was not that.  However, I played with the recipe and my non-GF family and friends like these now as well.  To the mix, I add TWO sticks of butter, TWO eggs (instead of the one each the bag recipe calls for), 1/3 cup of cocoa and more chocolate chips.  I cook them at the same temp for the same length of time and they come out great."
1431,B000EDBQ4M,A2HQL5KB584YBJ,K. Lowrey,5,"I bought these for my mother-in-law as a special treat for her on Mother's Day. She cannot have gluten in her diet and that makes meals for family get-togethers difficult to plan-- especially when it comes to desserts. I mixed up a batch (using real butter instead of margarine) and was a little worried when the batter stayed dry and just looked like loose crumbs in the bowl. But like the package says, it sticks into balls when you press together in your hands. I also have to admit that I tasted the raw batter ( I can't resist!) and it tasted funny, so again I was worried. When they came out of the oven they looked a little dry (worried again) but when they cooled off and I tasted them I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor. My mother-in-law will definitely be pleased."
1432,B000EDBQ4M,A33I6CUHXWW2LI,B. Miller,5,"I have to say ""WOW!"" to Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix. My order just came in today and we couldn't wait to try them. My son has been put on a gluten-free diet for his allergies so we thought our world had been turned upside down. Since we had been so happy with Bob's Red Mill GF Wonderful Bread Mix, we decided to try this cookie mix. As I was mixing the ingredients it just didn't look right (compared to a regular gluten cookie mix) and the batter tasted very strange. But once they were cooked I couldn't believe how delicious they were! So I guess the moral to the story is ""don't judge a cookie by its batter"" -- heehee! This mix will certainly be a new favorite for both the gluten-free and gluten eaters in our home! And boy am I glad we ordered 4 of these from Amazon--I have a feeling we'll be making more this weekend. Heehee!"
1433,B000EDBQ4M,A2M5HH9CQI59BV,Jennifer Carden,5,I have been experimenting  with gluten free cookie recipes. I just made these and added 1 tablespoon extra margarine  (these will be salty but yummy) and about 1 tablespoon soy milk. I also added some extra mini chips.  Under bake slightly and make sure you let them cool on the sheet then on a rack. I really love them.
1434,B000EDBQ4M,AOEERLQYCJ7OL,L. Desantis,5,"Surely there is an egg hiding in there somewhere, right?<br /><br />And heaping cups of wheat flour? Yeah? ....no??...wait. WHAT?<br /><br />These cookies! I have been gluten-free, dairy-free, and egg-free for a year now after finding out I'm allergic to basically everything on earth, and I hadn't allowed myself to try these yet because I'm also watching out for too much sugar. But I gave them a shot last night and I swear to you, I ate four. FOUR, bing bing bing bing. I was just going to eat one, maybe two. Then I was like okay one more. Okay ooooone more. (I didn't make them as large as the package I don't think, but honestly I don't care. I have no shame, I ate four cookies.)<br /><br />And each one was so delicious. They were chewy in the center, crispy on the outside. No disgusting aftertaste (I read some of the other lower reviews and can't figure out where that was coming from. Maybe it was a few years ago and they've since improved the mix?), no gritty or beany texture...I kept going back and re-reading the ingredients and looking at the packaging to make sure I wasn't completely delusional. Had I bought a non-gluten-free mix? This couldn't be this delicious, it just couldn't.<br /><br />My husband is not gluten free and he was flipping out about how good they were. I didn't even use an egg! I used the Ener-G egg replacer, and there was such a lovely chewiness and richness to these cookies. I was sure they'd be crumbly and gross as I was forming the dough together. I was afraid they'd taste weird, or be gritty and unappetizing like store-bought gluten free 'cookies' that I've tried (I've just given up trying new brands at this point).<br /><br />I could weep at how happy I am to have found this cookie mix. A true treat amidst repetitive failures this whole year trying to find great gluten-free alternatives. Bob's Red Mill, keep rocking on with your bad selves."
1435,B000EDBQ4M,AYRL0033UI557,NickWizz,2,After finding out that my girlfriend needed to eat gluten free we went on a search for a good chocolate chip mix. At first they have a good taste but moments later they leave a weird after taste. This is the first Bobs product I can't recommend.  I guess I will just make them from scratch unless I can or someone recommend a brand to me...
1436,B000EDBQ4M,A17PE57VHJY0GQ,Helga,1,"I am a cookie lover so was really excited when I found a cookie I could eat! However, the prepared dough from this mix smelled really bad. I didn't even lick the bowl like I usually do. I hoped that the cookies would be good after being baked, but boy was I wrong. They were so bad I couldn't even eat a whole cookie, honestly! If you gluten-free folks haven't yet found the perfect gluten-free cookie, check out the line of cookie mixes from Colie's Cookies ([...]). It's a new business and the products are only available online. I tried the sample pack consisting of 6 different flavors.. and all 6 were super yummy! Even my non-gluten-free friends and family said they were EXCELLENT and couldn't taste the ""gluten-free"" aspect! If you haven't yet tried them, you are in for a real treat!"
1437,B000EDBQ4M,AJZ6AU704SDH5,"M. Edison ""fire dude""",2,"At first I thoughts it tasted like soy flour was used as it had a similar smell; however, it is garbanzo bean flour???????????? This is the first miss for Bob's.  I won't reorder."
1438,B000EDBQ4M,AEN20F9AGL37H,"F. Adams ""GF mom""",5,"These cookies are really great and I bake them for all my family, which is a mix of gluten-intolerant and intolerant of gluten free. And they ALL love them. But I made a number of adjustments to the mix instructions to make them great.<br /><br />The instructions call for 1/2 cup (or 8 tablespoons) Margarine (cold) which gives you a mix that is the texture of wet sand, not so good for cookies. And a pain to pat and form into something that looks like a cookie but keeps falling apart.  I almost double the margarine, I put 13-14 tablespoons of margarine. More or less depending on how the dough looks.  This gives you a cookie dough texture that is just right for scooping.  I also add a shake or two of cinnamon (chocolate and cinnamon YUM!), a teaspoon of vanilla, more chocolate chips (I like the enjoy life, soy free, dairy free ones) and walnuts or pecans (optional).<br /><br />Now here's another very important new step.  I make the dough and then I wrap it in parchment paper/plastic baggie and leave it in the fridge for at least 5 hours of even overnight, or freeze it for another time.  Somehow this step really makes a difference in taste and texture of the baked cookie.  Then scoop it up and bake as normal.<br /><br />I know it seems like a lot extra to do but when you have to stay GF in a G world you find ways to make things work.  I make adjustments to just about all the mixes I buy. And these cookies (with my tweaks) have a great, look, taste and texture."

1440,B000EDBQ4M,A1VVIGVD6J9TY8,Jack,1,"I love the Betty Crocker chocolate chip cookie mix, but I can't have it anymore due to the milk in it. I also tend to like Bob's Red Mill products. I was excited to see this was a mix I could have. Despite other reviewer's advice to not try the dough, I did. It tastes just like a bean. I decided to add some vanilla and a little brown sugar. I tried the dough again, EW! Still awful. Unfortunately I was out of my allergy-friendly chocolate chips because this mix desperately needed some more chocolate chips! I cooked them hoping the flavor would improve. Taking other reviewer's advice, I cooked them a little long because the reviews said that is what makes the bean flavor go away. (Why not just use beans to begin with Bob's Red Mill??) I just ate a warm cookie, and while it wasn't so ""beany"" anymore, it wasn't good. They are very bland."
1441,B000EDBQ4M,A2NCCIOM54VRTJ,Angel Mom,2,"I made these cookies today for my daughter who has a gluten allergy and the rest of my family.  The kids were so excited to try these and boy...were we disappointed!  The substitute for flour in this mixture is garbanzo bean flour.  Really?  There are so many flour alternatives on the market and they put beans in this recipe.  And the dough really does have a bean aftertaste.  It starts off sweet and then the lasting effect is garbazo beans.  Not what I want in a cookie.  To make them better, we added more vanilla and then rolled the cookie dough in sugar.  It was the only way to cut the bean flavoring. Also I think they only add 25 chips so be sure and add more to your own recipe.  Betty Crocker's gluten free version is so much better!"
1442,B000EDBQ4M,A45D1IQOT71HW,lifeinTN,5,"We have made these twice now for my son who has several severe food allergies. He loves them! They did turn out different both times, but then both times were good so we didn't mind (my husband, who has no food allergies, eats just as many of them as my son). First time they were puffy and soft and never really 'settled' while cooking but tasted great. Second time they looked just like a stiff store-bought cookie and were crispy on the edges while gooey in the middle. The dough also looked different the each time - dry but combined well the first, and almost sticky the second. It seems there may be some kind of consistency issue but so far that has no hurt the quality or taste at all and we've been very pleased with this mix.<br /><br />Note: We made the cookies each time with Ener-G egg replacer.<br /><br />And yes, the dough smells awful but that hasn't hurt the taste of the cookies in the end!"
1443,B000EDBQ4M,A343W3C0APGURL,lilida,5,"A wonderful alternative if you are going gluten-free. Cookies bake up just like in the description, but I bake them 4 minutes longer for a really crispy cookie. This also helps tame the bean-like texture. I don't have a problem with gluten, but have been slowly ridding it from my diet, and this is a quick, easy and delicious way to enjoy cookies without the gluten."
1444,B000EDBQ4M,A3BZFZJG9LPFZ7,Thekings123,3,"My son was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease. So now were on a quest to find good alternatives to wheat products. A hard job at that. Just baked these cookies today. Be warned DO NOT TASTE THE DOUGH. It tastes awful. Also, do not bake these cookies to be soft. They need to be baked through. You'll understand if you taste the dough. He's nine he'll eat just about anything if it's sweet. I will be trying other brands in the future with 5 stars and better comments."
1445,B000EDBQ4M,AFA01IFOEL3PO,Abbymachin,5,"My son is allergic to wheat, dairy, eggs, soy, rice, and oats (plus more). It is nearly impossible to find cookies he can eat as almost all wheat free cookie recipes call for rice flour or oats. We were hesitant to try these because the Bob's wheat free brownies are pretty bad, but I'm SO glad we did! These were delicious and free of all of my son's allergens (the chocolate chips contain soy lecithin but his allergist said that does not contain enough soy protein to cause a reaction)! Not to mention so easy to make! It has directions for substituting the egg right on the package, and we used Earth Balance Soy Free Buttery Spread instead of butter. I did have to cook them for about 21 minutes instead of just 15 as the package states, but they outside is nice and crisp while the middles are still soft and delicious. I will definitely be buying this mix again!!"
1446,B000EDBQ4M,A2T3G6EOENY38D,E. Sherwood,4,"I just got finished baking these cookies. I tasted a chocolate chip before the bake and it tasted like no chocolate chip I have had before so that made me skeptical. They baked nice and round, had a good chewy consistency, and tasted just okay.<br /><br />I will do what others suggested and with the rest of my batch in the fridge, add the brown sugar and additional chocolate chips...I might even add the Andy's bits just to give it an additional minty kick. I think that will do it."
1447,B000EDBQ4M,A3DA04X0YQL9X2,Carla A,5,"We've been gluten free for awhile and I've experimented with different mixes and making from scratch.  Everyone has their own definition of the ""perfect"" chocolate cookie, this one is pretty close to mine.<br /><br />I absolutely love them.  They were chewy, had a nice rise to them, and the finished cookie tasted great.  As other reviewers have said, there aren't a lot of chocolate chips in them, so you could always add your own.<br /><br />The dough does feel differently, but when you start in gluten free baking, you have to get over the expectation that recipes will mix up the same as the ones with regular flour.  I did smell and taste the fava bean in the dough, but once they were baked I couldn't at all.  I don't think someone could tell these were gluten free at all if I didn't tell them."
1448,B000EDBQ4M,A2WMN47WS0WULT,Mcjen,5,"After having tried numerous gluten-free chocolate chip cookies, these are by far the best. The dough is kinda dry and crumbly but after cooking, they are moist."
1449,B000EDBQ4M,A1LFRPC4Y7RQE1,Moot Pt,3,"These cookies are easy to make, and maintain a nice shape during baking.  However, the flavor is not so great.  Gluten-free baking has come a long way in the last few years, and you can find good recipes and mixes that don't involve bean flours.  The bean flour flavor is pervasive and lingers in your mouth long after you eat the cookie.  Since we gluten-free eaters are sometimes desperate for baked goods, we tend to overlook slightly off flavors, but this was too much for me.  I will not buy the mix again."
1450,B000EDBQ4M,ANDWCJZL3MI1H,camille salvatore,5,Bought this cookie mix to make a gluten free cookie cake.  Used a hamburger bun pan to make round individual cookie cakes.  Then frosted edges with Naturally Nora chocolate frosting.  These cute cookies looked as good as The Great Cookie Company's and tasted just as good.  What a treat.  I actually used egg replacer due to allergy and added 1/4 cup dark brown sugar to batter.  Will make these again.  Delicious.
1451,B000EDBQ4M,AKYL7326JND79,Rebecca Martino,4,"I made these for my sister in law who has a mild/medium gluten sensitivity who was staying with us.for the weekend. As a person who typically eats gluten, I was impressed.<br /><br />First I made the amendment of adding an additional egg and stick of butter. The butter I use is Smart Butter blend. An additional half cup of chocolate chips. Also I let the dough rest in the fridge for about a half hour.<br /><br />It was very sticky, and my husband taste tested the dough said it was 'iron' like in taste. We baked for 15 minutes and let them cool a bit before eating. Everyone liked them and said the taste was 'normal'. Texture is different, more grainy, and they fall a little flat but that didn't matter to me. The next morning I ate one and it had a slight banana flavor. I had my coworkers try them and said the same about banana and thought they were decent without having known they were gluten free until after trying.<br /><br />Since I only made a few cookies I left the dough in the fridge overnight. The current batch I'm making rose up quit a bit more. They handled a little better too. My only complaint is the need to have 2 sticks of butter in relation to fat content."
1452,B000EDBQ4M,A20IQLFES5BDPG,"Ally Singh ""Sushi Snob""",5,"We recently chose to go GF to help clear up our daughter's eczema.  She was a little bummed, thinking she would not be able to enjoy freshly baked cookies anymore.  I picked up a pack of this mix at Whole Foods, and WOW!  These are very good.  I did modify the recipe a little bit, and added 1 tbs. organic canola oil, and about a 1/3 cup organic smooth peanut butter.  I think the extra oil and the peanut butter helped to make the cookies more doughy and less crumbly.  They are so good, we can't stop eating them!!"
1453,B000EDBQ4M,A12SAU7NR89O98,A. Olson,5,"We have a gluten free home due to 3 kids with Celiac and gluten allergies.  We have tried numerous cookies and mixes.  So far, this is our favorite.  Even my husband, who eats gluten and doesn't have a sweet tooth won't leave these alone.  They do not taste exactly like gluten cookies, but they are pretty good.  They are easy to make - add a bit of extra water if the mix is too crumbly."
1454,B000EDBQ4M,A3AHK3DGL0GCIY,Melissa,1,"Like another reviewer, we tried the brownies first and were in heaven, so we assumed the chocolate chip cookies would be just as good.  Boy were we wrong!  I had to add tons of vanilla to the dough to get rid of the bitter taste, but even that just slightly masked it.  Once they baked up they tasted better but they were still a far cry from a good chocolate chip cookie.  They can hardly be called chocolate chip cookies with how little ""chocolate"" is in them (carob).  Don't waste your time with this mix and make Alton Brown's gluten free cc cookies instead! [...]"
1455,B000EDBQ4M,A3V06GPBA8273U,P. Carson,5,These cookies turned out fabulous when i used a whole cup of unrefined coconut oil instead of margarine and cornstarch instead of eggs.  They were even slightly chewy and the coconut oil covered up any bad taste there might have been from the bean flour.  Even the dough tasted good.  We were very pleased!

I'm not sure what is happening with people getting a foul taste-prehaps the mix was stale? I freeze these as soon as they cool, then reheat in the microwave for a ""just baked"" flavor.

I don't know what cookies they were eating before but these in NO WAY taste or look like the homemade ones I make, nor did I expect them to.<br /><br />They are very easy to mix up but the dough is odd both in taste and in texture. After mixing, it appears quite crumbly but if you smoosh it together it will form a ball and then can be placed on cookie sheets. The taste of the dough has this....well, quite frankly yucky after-taste but thankfully that mostly goes away after they are baked.<br /><br />I got these mixes for my husband who was diagnosed with type II diabetes because some of the other gluten free products we'd tried were diabetic friendly but after reading the label found that not to be the case. In fact, if you are on any other kind of restricted diet, you should read the label before buying. Per every 2 cookies there is 180mg of sodium, 24g of sugar and 41g of carbs. Had I seen the label prior to buying, I would have passed. My bad.<br /><br />Bottom line: If I were gluten sensitive/intolerant, I would be thanking the God's above for these but since I'm not, I can't really say they are as good as regular cookies and if like me, you are thinking these will fill the bill as a healthier alternative if you are on a restricted diet of some other kind then the answer to that is no and they don't claim to be. I just want to save someone else from making the same assumptions I misguidedly made and is in NO WAY the fault of the maker but just my own mistake.<br /><br />I didn't give them 3 stars because they don't fit in with the diabetic diet but because they just didn't taste that good to me, my husband or either of my parents. Not horrible, just not what I would describe as ""tasty""."

My son cannot have eggs either, so we went with the corn starch alternative recommendation on the package and WOW are these great! We have been through PLENTY of store bought Gluten Free cookies and as I'm sure you know --> cardboard anyone? These are not like them AT ALL. We added a little more ""butter alternative"" (since I would normally add more butter to the regular Nestle recipe) and NO ONE could tell the difference (I told my husband they were GF AFTER he inhaled 3 and even he couldn't tell!). We are just delighted that my son can be included in GOOD warm milk and cookies this year."

My five year old son says he wants me to put in the review that these cookies make ""super horrible cookies and dough"". I bake all the time and have made many gluten free desserts.  I like the Bob's Red Mill brownies but these cookies have a horrible aftertaste that does not go away after they are cooked as one reviewer stated. In fact, after making the first batch and reading the glowing reviews here I bought another bag and made them again because I figured I must have had a bad bag but the second bag was just as bad.  We threw the cookies and the rest of the dough away after tasting them. I made some other chocolate chip cookies with the Gluten Free Pantry all purpose flour (using a regular recipe)and they tasted much better."

Well...They were dry and cooked up very strangely but were cookie-like nonetheless.  So down the hatch and the taste and consistency was AWFUL !.. Lesson.. !! If you want to be healthy, eat a piece of fruit! - and have real cookie once in while in moderation..

I am happy to say that I have found it in spades in this brand!  The bergamot comes through not only in the aroma but also the taste. (I also really like the color of the box!) This company also makes a ""double bergamot"" Earl Grey but I actually prefer the regular (this one) to the double. If you have become unhappy with your current Earl Grey, I recommend that you give this one a try."

When I first visited China I was amazed at how quickly after pouring the boiling water into the pot, they poured out the ""finished"" tea.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Keurig machine and have it perfect for making this tea.  I only drink it iced, perhaps that is the difference?  Two bags in the permanent filters and run through twice (using the large cup setting).  Poured over ice with a bit of milk.  I use Stevia for my sweetener.<br /><br />No bitterness.  Just perfectly brewed aromatic Chai Tea.  With the double spice, it gives my tastebuds the perfect ""kick"" that I desire."
1486,B003CK7O36,A97S0CNOB0CH7,burninghorse,4,"This chai has good flavor but needs more black tea leaves to make a fully satisfying cup of tea. It leans on cloves but not overly, to my taste. The Tazo chai has more tea leaves and tastes very good if used properly -- 2 mugs of tea or an extra large mug from each tea bag. I've gotten used to the Stash spicing now (have enjoyed 6 boxes) and like to drink both the Stash and the Tazo (also finished 6 boxes), which I drink straight, in succession, in the morning. Then I switch to decaf Tazo chai which is very good and makes 2 mugs per tea bag."

Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once, but then a second shipment was excellent.  But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices."

Earl Grey seems to be a difficult tea to blend properly: without the proper proportion and quality of bergamot, the tea is either astringent or overly flowery. In my opinion, Stash gets the blend just right with their standard Earl Grey (the decaf version is also terrific, but to my taste the double bergamot drowns the tea flavor). I've tried several other brands, and can hardly drink the others. Don't say you dislike Earl Grey before trying this blend!"

After trying Twinings, Bigelow and a few others, I discovered Stash and found it to have a fresher, cleaner taste with a more pronounced bergamot fragrance. It costs slightly more than the others but seems well worth it to me. Also, buying it in quantity through Amazon brings the cost down significantly as compared to local grocery chains."

Not only can you select it for your lunch but you can buy a box from the stock they keep on hand. Because it's a family owned restaurant (not a chain) naturally they have to charge enough to pay for s/h. I found it a little cheaper at Vitamin Cottage. I always had a big cup after lunch at my desk at the post office where I worked in the passport office. Every time customers or other clerks would come in they would say ""wow what smells so delicious?"". It began to happen that I would make a trip to Hobnob or Vit Cott and they would be out of my tea. That flavor does not seem to be carried even in stores that carry Stash. So I found it by accident on Amazon while looking for something else entirely. I was so happy. If I purchase enough at a time it saves me nearly a dollar a box over all. I drink it every day so VOILA I found a great deal on Amazon. Thank you!!!"

This Earl Grey variant is the best I have tried out of many. There may be ones stronger in both aspects of the black tea and bergamot or more balanced -- but I only know that this ""Double Bergamot Earl Grey"" is a very balanced rich black tea with bergamot -- and it is organic like other Stash teas. This doubled bergamot Earl Grey is great hot with milk and brown sugar -- or icy with just a tad lemon or lime to add to the bergamot -- or without such additions. Also it is so rich someone can add it to other plain, even modest, black tea [bags one-for-one] for a more mellow bergamot tea. I even found it interesting with black mint tea [bags one-for-one] as this variant is not overwhelmed by other teas +++"

My hubbie drinks it with no additions at all and it is his ""pre-sleep"" tea of choice.  I've also used 5-7 bags in my iced tea maker and the result is yummy iced tea (or, add just a bag of this tea to regular tea for a hint of spice).  Stash teas are great overall.  I like the fact that they are individually wrapped in a ""foil"" wrap that holds together well and can be taken to the office or wherever without dissolving in one's pocket or purse!

It's everything a good breakfast tea should be."

The regular Earl Grey in this brand is also excellent, but the 'double bergamot' variety has a little more flavor than the Stash's regular Earl Grey.  I highly recommend both, and if you are curious like I was, treat yourself to one or both of these, and you will probably never want to purchase any other brand.<br /><br />I'm not sure the reason, but the other brands I've tried just do not taste as good.  Whatever Stash is doing with this tea recipe, it works."

The Bergamot is the reason I love this Earl Grey tea above all others.  I am giving this a good review before trying it because that's how much I love the Stash Premium Earl Grey.<br />I would recommend newbies to try the Premium first.  This is a winner among Earl Grey teas.  No one does it better than Stash.<br />I'm tempted to try their Chai Spice Tea.  Celestial Seasonings Vanilla Honey is my favorite.  If Stash makes it better I'm in heaven.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Didn't find a big difference between the Double and Premium Earl Grey.  Still love them.

I agree that it is not for the faint-hearted or those with a hypersensitive palate.

The citrus flavor is noticeably different from other Earl Greys. The box says that in addition to bergamont, other citrus flavors have been added. Personally, I taste a touch of grapefruit in the mix, which makes this tea a bit more lively than your typical blend. Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my goto is Bigelow's. I find Twinings to be too light and a bit sour.  My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and you don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo. Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves."

1556,B003CK7O36,A32EF8CKB8RSRT,Lonely Tourist,3,"I purchased 3 different flavors of Stash tea when it was on sale at Sprouts after seeing the great reviews on Amazon.  I must say, Stash makes mediocre tea.  There's something about the aroma and taste of their teas that does not agree with my senses.  Maybe it's the cloying smell of the bergamot in their Earl Grey.  I prefer Twinings, especially their Lady Grey tea over Stash.  Of all the teas I've tried so far, Ahmad's fruit-flavored teas are my favorite (especially the Peach & Passion Fruit Black Tea, but the mango is good as wel).  Aroma and taste is amazingly refreshing."

Woods,2,"Not familiar with what ""chai"" tea is supposed to taste like but this tea tasted like stewed cloves to me  Yuck.Got this flavor in a sampler box and, so far, it's the only Stash tea I've tried and disliked strongly. Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water."

You can drink it with or without milk and sweetening, but remember that most chai teas you buy in tea and coffee shops have both milk and sweetening in them.  It can be served either hot or chilled.<br />The price is excellent, and I can get it in quantity so I don't (Heaven forbid!) run out.

It's quite good Chai tea, but I'd rather drink organic Allegro chai tea (available at Whole Foods for close to this price) than buy this stuff.  The good news is that unlike some teas on Amazon, this one is very fresh and has a good sell-by date.  I ordered it only a few weeks ago, and it is good until 11/2012.  So if you don't care about organic tea, and you want a nice chai with strong cinnamon overtones, this is a pretty good one.

I love chai and used to order loose leaf ( at a high price) from a place online that doesn't have it anymore. I guess you get what you pay for.

Did you know that bergamot is a type of sour orange?  When you smell the tea knowing that the scent is citrus, you can distinguish it but I didn't figure it out on my own.<br /><br />Anyway, oil of bergamot is what makes Earl Grey tea something different from just plain tea.  The DOUBLE bergamot is what makes this particular Earl Grey tea a new taste experience (at least for me).<br /><br />Here's a link to the Wikipedia entry for Earl Grey tea:<br />[...]"
1583,B003CK7O36,AVE9KNJYJDESB,"W. Doug Bolden ""book addicted librarian""",4,"I am an Earl Grey fan, and I am currently enjoying a thermos of Stash's Double Bergamot as we speak. The citrus background of the standard Earl Grey mix is definitely amped up, making it into the central focus of the tea (as opposed to the black tea base). It is obvious you are still drinking tea, mind you, but now the bergamot flavoring is a lot more transparently citrus in origin.<br /><br />Cup by cup is probably the best way to make it your first time out. Making it by the traditional ""full pot"" method of ""1 per person and 1 per pot"" (and for me, often ""1 extra just for the fun of it"") makes the taste borderline spicy. This is how I first sampled it and it caused me to cough upon my initial swallow because I knew it was strong but was not quite expecting that level of strength. I recommend a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk to help bring the taste into roundness.<br /><br />Like Lapsang Souchong, this tea has a distinctive flavor that seems perfect for waking you up on a cold morning or refreshing you after a long day's hike. It gives me a little extra perk at work, and I like that.<br /><br />However, I cannot five star this tea because the flavor is a little too intense for the more casual drinker. I like having tea socially, and sharing it with my friends. Most of them outright dislike this one or only sip it sparingly (just like the aforementioned Lapsang Souchong).<br /><br />Earl Grey fans, however, can rest assured that it is a five star review for them."

I have always been a fan of Early Grey tea and didn't think I'd find anything I like more BUT then I drank Stash's DOUBLE Bergamot, which just happens to be the ingredient in Earl Grey that makes it so good, and I've been hooked ever since. I drink alot of tea and this is what I drink....Try it, you'll like it!"
1585,B003CK7O36,A2P1O2B865EBI3,Sultaria,5,"I have just bought this tea yesterday and made a traditional ""chai"", as I normally do. I've used other brands and types of bagged chai tea before, and they were decent, but nothing like this. I absolutely love my chai to be extremely spicy, and this is it. No other varieties of Stash Chai or even their other teas can compare to this. This is simply delicious when made with milk and sugar. Save the money you spend on a Starbucks Chai latte and buy a box instead. It's MUCH better and less expensive when made right.<br /><br />I usually make chai from scratch, but this is definetely a time saver and tastes amazing. Highly recommended."
1586,B003CK7O36,A1LQMI5ASSB1OY,K. Cummings,3,"Most bagged chai blends aren't very good at all.  There, I said it.  There are a few that have authentic taste but are just too weak overall, and unfortunately, Stash Double Spiced Chai falls into that category despite hitting all the right notes with the spices.<br /><br />Upon opening a bag for the first time, I was concerned that this would be overloaded with too much cinnamon, but from the green stains on the bag it was apparent that they stuck a load of cardamom in there as well, which is a good thing.  With milk and sugar, though, the black tea just did not have the strength needed to counter-balance the spice medley.  Things improved when I added a second bag to the cup, but overall it was just too bitter and again, the BODY that you expect the black tea to provide just wasn't there.  With a different or stronger tea base Stash could have a real winner here, because they certainly have the spice blend right on."

Great time to get into my jammies and curl up with a cup of Stash Tea, put on my favorite singer (BM) and write Amazon reviews for you fine folks out there!<br /><br />I have been a tea drinker all my life, and Stash is great tea.  This flavor is wonderful and one of my old favorites.  Now they have plenty new and creative flavors but this still remains wonderful, simple, and basic, with a nice smooth peach flavoring.  Stash is stronger than your basic tea bags (Lipton, etc.) so depending on how strong you like your tea, you might only need one bag for a 24 oz cup like I do.  I drink it black with natural unbleached sugar or agave nectar (sweetener made from cactus juice and available in many food stores in the organic section.)<br /><br />Great flavor and worth the price difference."
1590,B003CK7O36,A3D03P6CPF7PUL,Negril,5,"I received a variety of Stash teas as a Bridal Shower souveneir over a year ago. I'm sorry i took so long to bust 'em open. Stash is an amazing quality with natural tasting, comforting flavours in both the Herbal and Black Tea lines. I am so impressed, I've become a Stash convert.<br /><br />This Double Chai is very well balanced in it's spices, but still comforting and yet refreshing at the same time. I made mine mostly according to the directions (tea is easy that way), but i did use sweetened condensed milk instead of regular milk and sugar. It may not be 'Starbucks Quality' as one reviewer lamented, but I'm sure the beauty of Chai is that it can be well made in a variety if different ways. And while i've never been big into Chai, in the future, I'm definitely going to keep a stock of this Chai tea in my pantry. And unlike many other common brands of black tea, this one does not go bitter after 5-10 minutes of steeping. I'm used to having to be vigilant about removing the bag after 3 minutes, because I'm sensitive to the bitter over-steeped taste of lower quality black teas. That was not at all an issue with either of the black teas I've tried from this company. I can't wait to buy more Stash Teas."
1591,B003CK7O36,A3ER3V2E06DH7D,"A. K. Kaw ""AKK""",5,"Well, I am an Earl Grey Fan - I drink 1 cup a day.  I have tried Earl Grey from Tazo, Twinings, Bigelow, etc but this one beats them in taste. The aftertaste is what makes the tea good.  It has a smooth flavor - and I can taste that flavor with milk and sugar too."
1592,B003CK7O36,A3QLDMN9FH2R12,Winifred,2,"This tastes nothing like my two favorite chai teas, Celestial Seasons and Allegro. It reminds me of Constant Comment (an old Bigelow tea, I believe)."
1593,B003CK7O36,A3LS3CMFXQ8V5H,June Robin,4,"This black tea is not very strong; it's priced reasonably though.  If you're adding a dash of milk into your black tea, this won't do.  If you're drinking it as is, without milk or sugar; it's quite decent.  Faint aroma, doesn't taste as strong or smell as good as Tazo's Awake.  Nevertheless, pretty good value for what you get."
1594,B003CK7O36,A3MY8WZ744LQGF,Michael Nastasi,5,I like the convenience of tea bags.  This is one of the better premium brands in terms of freshness and flavor.  Great value compared to supermarket price!

1596,B003CK7O36,A2Q9W8Q6P1K0T1,Beverly Spejewski,1,"I love Earl Grey tea.  I dislike this.  The bergamot is some weird essence very different from others I have had, and I do not enjoy it at all.  Kind of too fruity and flowery, and not woodsy and sophisticated.  My office mate said it smelled like whisky and Southern Comfort added to tea.  Not what I was looking for."
1597,B003CK7O36,A1GNMHJPWPG2AM,Smart Shopper,5,"I love this tea. I just wish it was organic because I drink so much of it! I only drink it with a little milk and honey. The milk softens the tannins and seems to develop the floral scent of the bergamot oil.<br /><br />I've tried several other brands that offer high bergamot earl grey but none of them have that wonderful scent that this tea has. This absolutely the best high bergamot earl grey I've ever tasted. I may try purchasing my own bergamot oil and making my own because I want to drink this tea at least 5 times a day, and if I'm going to be steeping that many leaves, I want them to be pesticide free. I just hope that I can reproduce a flavor that comes close to the flavor of this tea."
1598,B003CK7O36,A1AEQZM99LO9VA,Debra Koch,1,"This is a weak, bad, imitation of an Earl Grey tea. Even Bigelow Earl Grey is better, but Twinings is the best. Stash teas in general are weak and not that good, I especially dislike all the tea grounds in the bottom of my cup with Stash teas."

1604,B003CK7O36,A3JLECMNWC4LDY,Lorinzo,1,"I'm really curious as to what ""blended black tea"", means. It doesn't say it on the ingredients list, but it smells and tastes just like menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil, with a nice blend of cinnamon, which it does list. In removing it from the wrapper, it had such a strong aroma of Vick's Vapor Rub, that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink. However, I did want to try it, so here I am, alive and still kicking. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth, and the packaging is easy on the eyes. Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though, in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage. The ingredients are: blended black tea, ginger root, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, clove oil, allspice, nutemeg, clove, and cardamon oil. Because of the unknown element, I wouldn't be surprised if they started marketing it, as a familiar cold remedy. Todd Wilbur?...you missed one."
1605,B003CK7O36,A32EF8CKB8RSRT,Lonely Tourist,3,"First time I tried Stash Chai Spice Black Tea, I hated it.  Something about the smell did not appeal to me.  It inspired me to go to the local Indian grocer and purchase my own spices to make chai from scratch.  That was very successful (with help from the Internet and advice from an Indian friend).  I finally came back to try Stash's Chai again today and the first thing that hit me was the strong clove scent, which doesn't bother me as much after a few minutes.  I think the chai tastes a bit better this time around than when I first tried it.  Kinda grows on you, I guess.  However, it's not GREAT chai by any means.  It's okay for chai in a teabag.  Convenient.  But I'll stick to making it from scratch when I finally finish this box (waste not)."
1606,B003CK7O36,A27Y8P5E3704WM,R. Bentzley,1,"I have been a fan of chai tea for a long time and occassionally will try different brands.  In my book, a good cup of chai tea does not require sugar and cream, and has tastes of cinnamon, vanilla, and cardamon.  I picked up this box at the local store because it was relatively inexpensive in comparison to most of the other brands.  I also hoped that ""double spice"" meant double the tea servings. I was wrong.  Like other reviewers have observed, the tea tasted very bitter.  An extremely strong black pepper note seemed to overwhelm the rest of the spices.  I have liked other Stash brand teas, but I was very disappointed with this one.  Unfortunately, the box now sits in the cabinet collecting dust."

Some other Earl Grey's I have used have more Bergamot flavoring in 1 tea bag then this little tea in 4. Thus I am rather disappointed! Although for a regular Earl Grey fan this tea might be good, for the Bergamot enthusiast it is not recommendable."
1608,B003CK7O36,A1QBECGZ0M6MX1,A. Enniss,1,"Doesn't smell or taste like the real traditional Earl Gray. Horrible taste! I guess people who loves it never had the real thing, the way you can get it in England. I personally find that all tea from this company is bad, but than again, I'm not an American and I do have different taste."
1609,B003CK7O36,A1SCANWWQTEG9I,TheLastCoyote,2,"I enjoy many types of tea, the more flavorful the better. I received this in a sampler that I purchased and did not find it to be very good.

It is as strong as going loose leaf, but the quality of the better loose leafs is better than this tea. It is great for convenience.

It's the best bagged black tea I've discovered, though we've enjoyed PG Tips and Yorkshire teas. This ""Irish Breakfast"" tea is strong, without being overly tannic or sour. It's not like loose Lapsang Souchong, being a far more mellow smokey experience. If you crave an authentic, comforting tea that reminds you of being far from the maddening crowd, perhaps in a safer environ of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011B9W38"">Midsomer</a> than Badger's Drift, than this is the tea for you.

Personally, I ""brew"" the tea using the following method:<br /><br />1. Fill cup with water, leaving enough room for milk and sugar after brewing (if you use those items).<br /><br />2. Put the bag in the cold water cup and microwave for about 2 minutes.<br /><br />3. Remove from microwave and allow to steep another minute.<br /><br />4.

1616,B003CK7O36,A36TRTRHLUZTU6,ryguy,5,"I enjoy a variety of teas from herbal to traditional to Green & White's, but generally prefer green teas.  I found the Stash brand on sale once and they had a huge selection, so I picked 5 or 6 varieties to try, including the Double Bergamot Earl Grey.  I had originally planned to pass on this variety, but thought I may as well give it a try.  As the days went on I tried each of the varieties one by one and really enjoyed them.  Then finally I got to the DB Earl Grey.  I didn't have high expectations for it, but let me tell you -- I was absolutely blown away by this tea.  It is perhaps the best tasting, most full-bodied and yet elegant tea (I know that's a strange word to describe tea with) I've ever tasted.  If you like regular Earl Greys, you will LOVE this tea.  You can tell the Bergamot oil is of very high quality.  Take your time to inhale the scent of the tea bag before you even start brewing -- it's that good.  The taste cannot be compared to any other Earl Grey I've had, and I've had some very good ones.  And you can brew quite a large cup (like a double tea-cup size) with one bag.  This tea is very full-bodied, so if you like your teas weaker, don't leave it brewing for too long.  They did not skimp on this tea and you really owe it to yourself to give it a try."

Well this tea smells amazing but it is very very weak. I have to use 2 teabags vs 1 twinnings tea bag and seep it for 7+ min in order to get the equal flavor i would get from twinnings. I wish this tea was stronger in flavor not just in smell.

1620,B003CK7O36,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,T. Fisher,5,"As someone who really enjoys Earl Grey, I was drawn to the sensationalism of the ""Double Bergamot"" marketing ploy. While this tea does have a clear bergamot flavor as you would expect from an Earl Grey, I cannot say I found it particularly revolutionary. Rather, this tastes like a good Earl Grey, and for the price I believe it is probably one of the better ones out there.<br /><br />I can't say it's overcome my favorite among standard Earl Grey teabags -- that remains <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003F18GPC"">Pickwick Earl Grey</a>, which I had not found in the US until very recently. But at less than half the price, this Stash product delivers much better in price performance terms.<br /><br />Of course, if you're willing to spend a lot more, there are better teas out there. Like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NNB6H0"">this one in silk sachets by Harney & Sons</a>. But this is an outstanding performer in its category. It also makes great iced tea.

I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it.

I've probably purchased ten or twelve different brands of Chai looking for the right one.  I finally found it with this Stash Premium Double Spice.  It is exceptionally flavorful, and really able to hold the strong flavor.  The aroma is incredible.  Although it has cinnamon, it doesn't strike me as particularly cinnamony -- I think the cardamom flavor may come through a little more strongly.  Nor is it particularly spicy -- I can't handle spicy foods and I don't have a problem with this.  This tea is a little heartier than most -- I have taken to drinking it instead of coffee in the morning.<br /><br />I haven't been quite as impressed with the other Stash teas I've tried (they're okay, but nothing special) and generally prefer Mighty Leaf or Tazo -- but this tea quickly jumped to the top of my favorites list -- I'll be ordering much more."

It didn't taste like tea to me at all!  It was more like hot chocolate, only with spices instead of chocolate.  I thought I'd gone to heaven.  I regretted not bringing some of the Tazo tea home later.  I just started craving the stuff.  I found Tazo Chai Spice at the supermarket, but wasn't happy with the price.<br /><br />So I thought I'd try Stash.  I already buy some of their green teas.  It's even better than Tazo!  The Spice Chai or Double Spice Chai, they're both delicious.  The Double just has more spices and works better with milk.  Or cream :)  Makes the house smell good, too.  Not knocking Tazo, either, after all, I did rave about their tea.

Seems stores have limited shelf space and rarely carry ""specialty"" items like the Double Bergamot Earl Grey.  If you like Earl Grey, you will adore the Earl with Double Bergamot.  Very distinctive flavor.  Unique!  Thankfully Amazon sells the six-pack of this special tea, which we get on automatic delivery so we never run out.  Priced better than the local stores."

But, this has two types of cloves which I knew weren't my favorite but it also had cardomon oil which is my favorite spice.  But the cloves overpower everything else.  Numi golden chai has no cloves whatsoever so I recommend it if you want to avoid those pesky cloves.  Oh, Numi also does not have black pepper which is traditional in chai tea but is also a taste I don't like in my tea."

I'm not sure what the difference is, unless that maybe Stash just uses more of the bergamot in their recipe.

When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it."

Because chai contains lots of spices, like other spicy things, it is better if the spices have the opportunity to mellow out. Basically, the longer you leave it, the better it gets. You can leave it over night or as long as you want.

I use it for a variety of meals in place of ham, and it works out fine for me (Macaroni and Cheese with Broccoli and turkey SPAM; in Salads, etc. -- just as good as the traditional dishes).<br /><br />Unfortunately, several cans were badly dented upon arrival, making them unsafe to eat, really. So the high price was not worth paying.  But as it was during the winter storm, ""Blizzard-Geddon"" of 2010 (78"" snow total), I thank the Lord for having even the dented cans on hand!

I just assume that the really good turkeys are sold intact, with the innards removed, so there must be plenty of other parts we don't get to see, or turkeys that are not worth trying to sell intact, that goes into this lowest fat of all of the famous and legandary SPAM product.<br /><br />The good news is that it's way easier to slice than a real turkey, and you can cook it in a few minutes.  And yes, I really recommend slicing and browning this stuff in a frying pan.

1693,B001EQ5NJM,A3PE884TA8529G,J. E. Nelson,2,"I grew up in SE Alaska back in the 70's when the transportation infrastructure was not as good as it is today.  Sometimes, things like fresh meats, fruits, vegetables, and dairy were a bit expensive back then.  While fried Spam was not a staple back then for us, it was definitely a regular on the menu.<br /><br />Now in my mid 30s, I work a lot of late nights and was looking for something quick and easy to eat, yet actually has protein and is filling.  Walking down the grocery aisle, it jumped out at me, viola, Spam.<br /><br />While it no longer sports its key that you used to tear away that thin strip of metal, it was just as I remembered.  However, I no longer had the metabolism of a child.  I am already festively plump, so I figured I better lay off the blue Spam.<br /><br />So I decided to give the Turkey Spam a try.  At about half the calories and much less fat, how could I go wrong.<br /><br />What separates Spam from the cheap Wal-Mart knock off for me is that Spam has a nice firm texture which other imitation brands do not seem to have.  While I would give the taste of the Turkey Spam 4 stars, the texture was terrible.  The texture was soft and mushy, much like the imitation Spam products.  Personally, it reminded me of eating a can of cat food.  After eating a few slices, I could not bring myself to finish the can.  I did not try frying it.  Perhaps some further cooking would firm it up a bit.<br /><br />If you are a Spam addict and figure you need to shave some calories out of your diet, it is definitely worth a try.  The taste was not bad at all.  However, if the texture of your mystery meat products is important to you, I'd probably stick to Spam blue."

Not sure, really, what I expected but was not sold on this at all. Did not have the taste of regular Spam but did not have the taste of roasted turkey either. Not sure what it tasted like. I proceeded to prepare it as I always do for sandwiches....heated up a non-stick skillet and sliced the product. Now I realize that this product is leaner than the regular Spam, and having said that I know now that I should have sprayed the skillet with a non-stick spray such as Pam. The product stuck to the pan like crazy and I was not able to fry it up evenly. This gave the procuct a mushy texture that was not pleasing. If you try it make sure you spray your pan first to avoid the sticking. Again, while eating it I was trying to figure out what it tasted like......still not sure.

1701,B001EQ5NJM,AOINAOO0NQRGN,Rooster Eberle,4,"I've been buying Spam products from Amazon over the past year. I tend to favor Spam Turkey, With Bacon, and With Cheese, so my commentary focuses on these three. Each of these three can be fairly tasty depending on the exact use. When Amazon's pricing dips below $15, then it beats pricing at my local supermarket. Above $15, and I start checking out my local sales.<br /><br />An obvious consideration with Pam is its nutritional value, or possible lack there of. So I looked up some of the relevant nutritional information, some of which I will repeat here. You should consider doing the same.<br /><br />Each can of Spam holds 12 ounces, or six servings (in Hormel's estimation). Each serving of Turkey Spam has 80 calories. The bacon and cheese versions have 180 and 170 calories, respectively.<br /><br />A serving of Turkey Spam has 4.5 grams of total fat and 1.5 grams of saturated fat. The numbers for Bacon Spam are 16 and 6 grams. And for Cheese Spam, the numbers are 15 and 6 grams. The recommended daily reference values are 65 and 20 grams.<br /><br />A serving of Turkey Spam has 35 mg of cholesterol while the others have 40 mg of cholesterol. The recommended daily value is 300 mg.<br /><br />A serving of Turkey Spam And Bacon Spam have 520 mg of sodium. Cheese Spam has 720 Mg. The recommended daily value is 2400 mg.<br /><br />Essentially this means that Turkey Spam is healthier than the others, but any of these versions of Spam can fit into a nutritious program SO LONG AS you limit the servings and don't use a lot of fatty oil if you fry your servings. If you insist on eating a whole can every day, you will tend to be fat with clogged arteries and high blood pressure.<br /><br />I don't fry my Spam although it's tempting to do that a slice at a time for breakfast. Instead, I tend to use Turkey Spam diced in pasta salads and sliced for sandwiches. The cheese and bacon versions have a more distinctive taste, and I use them mostly to add some meat to the Betty Crocker mashed potatoes that I also buy from Amazon.<br /><br />Of course, Spam IS very tasty and when fried is always a winner with kids. As long as they don't gorge themselves on it, it should be fine. In the end, the key with Spam as with many other foods is to be moderate and balanced in what you eat.<br /><br />I hope this helps."

Especially if you need meat that does not have to be refrigerated.<br /><br />This product I did purchase from Amazon even though it is not verified that I did. That is because I purchased it with my husband's account."
1703,B001EQ5NJM,A1S21GSXW4M5D7,Luke Rymarz,5,"I've only had this flavor of Spam, but it's delicious.  Plus, I think it's got the least amount of fat of all the Spam flavors.  Check out the official Spam website for nutritional info."
1704,B001EQ5NJM,A3OFJES10PZGEH,SN,4,"It's great you can cut it down to size for anything!<br />Diced for salads, thin slices for sandwiches,<br />long and thick for hot dogs, etc.<br /><br />You should refrigerate any unused portion.<br />I keep it bagged and soaked in water in the frige,<br />because lack of oxygen and lower temp slows down degradation.<br />You could say it's filled with preservatives and salt,<br />ok smarty pants, it's true Spam lasts forever.<br /><br />This is perfect for emergency kits.<br />It's not too big and heavy.<br />Be sure to buy the other varieties,<br />you'll get sick of eating Turkey Spam everyday."
1705,B001EQ5NJM,AVLRMBJ1XJL18,JustAGuy,2,"Poorly packed without any bubble or other cushion wrap to prevent damage.  Amazon usually does much better than this.  One of the six cans was dented so badly it was leaking, thus had to be discarded.  Similarly denting with one leaking can in last shipment of the Spam with Cheese product.  Initial shipments arrived well-packed and undamaged, but I can't afford to throw away one of every six cans.  Am cancelling subscription to this product."
1706,B001EQ5NJM,A1SIJJ5KHG3DXY,"R. Smith ""TSP-MSB""",5,"It has a very good flavor that works well on a sandwich or with a salad.<br /><br />It tastes nothing like regular SPAM, since the original is make from pork.<br /><br />If your looking for a leaner alternative to original SPAM, then turkey SPAM is for you."
1707,B001EQ5NJM,AFAPAQFCEYVNT,W. C. Price,4,"This product is great eaten two ways: cooked or refrigerated. Both of those choices give the product a nice, firm texture. It bugs me that so many folks are complaining that the texture is a little mushy at room temperature... That's true, sure, but it takes very little effort to substantially improve your experience. It's as if someone complained that a potato doesn't taste very good if you don't peel it or cook it before you eat it.<br /><br />Either cook it or refrigerate it and you'll be perfectly happy--seriously."
1708,B001EQ5NJM,A1I9ZZ6WUBQZT3,Wramblin' Wreck,5,"I am very, very impressed with this particular seller, Shopping Store.  They sent the Turkey Span amazingly quickly and efficiently.  I received it two days after I placed the order even though I specified Standard shipping.  I plan to purchase other products from Shopping Store in the future.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of turkey.  I will make an extra large turkey at Thanksgiving so I will have plenty of leftover turkey for later.  Turkey Span will be a reasonable substitute the rest of the year.  It will pair well with eggs, make good casseroles and decent sandwiches, just to name a few uses.  It also has a good turkey flavor."

And it began to be okay as food again!"
1713,B001EQ5NJM,A2JZ062DPCHXNJ,janjenn,4,"Actually it tastes a lot like the deviled ham that comes in those tiny little cans wrapped in paper, only better.<br /><br />I sliced the turkey spam with my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W26466"">MIU France Stainless Steel Lunch Meat Slicer</a>, fried it and turned it into a yummy spamburger with a little lettuce, tomato and mayo.<br /><br />I also use the slicer to make diced spam for spam salad with mayo, pickle relish, chopped onion and diced hard boiled eggs and it's tasty diced, lightly fried and scrambled into eggs with a little hot sauce.<br />As you can see, I like turkey spam best with a variety of other bland foods.  This because it has a lot of flavor and a way too much salt."

I would give it 1 out of 10. tastes like filthy animal flesh. you KNOW what I mean; you fellow Spam haters.<br /><br />Turkey Spam is pretty good; not great. I'd give it 7 out of 10. it's worth a try if you haven't.
1716,B001EQ5NJM,A2H0TBU1DSNJRB,sandcastlefan,1,"I simply wanted a good source of lean protein on hand for quick meals.  This would have to doctored up quite a lot with spices, veggies and sauces to be palatable."

1718,B001EQ5NJM,A2H3VX4HXRFW4G,Mary Godfrey,1,"This product is not even remotely flavored like oven roasted turkey.  I want this item cancelled.  Also, the other Spam products while flavorful, are much too salty."

Ended up costing over $7.oo a can. Can no longer order from SPAM, why, I don't know. But anyway since it is turkey, I will have a can just for Thanksgiving."
1720,B004HE7PXA,A2YI8LVNJRWNCY,lulupam,5,Adds great flavor to meats and stews...ground very fine so breaks down easy.  Just got to clean out a spice jar for it otherwise will be messy sitting in the bag.  Will be purchasing more from the company.  Not always easy to find gluten free products with a reasonable price.

1725,B0040QBAU4,A29KEBGOFM7WP3,heinz,5,Our vet said that these treats are very good for our dogs. She said the flaxseed is especially good for them.
1726,B0050IKPMA,A12OL5Z4UNJYRD,Bigdogbeau,5,A little on the expensive side for sure but worth it for a once in a while treat.  The flavor is excellent with no lingering nasty taste you are probably used to from eating processed salami's.  This is a very good product and a good company to deal with.
1727,B0050IKPMA,A9VZP67MNIGSG,Patrick Russ,4,"Love the product on the whole but the packaging was sub-par basically a ziplock bag with one freeze pack that had melted by the time I received the box, some insulation in the box and multiple freeze packs would ensure the meat arrives still chilled and not hot."
1728,B001M121M6,A33KZW6PHI3SCI,J. Vulk,5,My daughter in law sent me these from England.  They are absolutely delicious.  There is a variety of great tasting cookies and each one is covered with wonderful Cadbury milk chocolate.
1729,B006FUL4AE,A1FAX2O8F49LHO,worldwar2,5,This is the absolute best lemonade  I have ever had. Not too sweet or tart.  The very lite carbonation  adds just the right touch.  As soon as this gets added to subscribe and save my standing order will be placed.
1730,B006FUL4AE,AA8T3LYCOCBOP,Jayj,5,"This lemonade is a great replacement for sugary drinks! Unlike other brands of flavoured water this doesn't have any sodium!!!<br />It's a little pricey for water, but it's wonderful if you're on a diet or just want to cut down on your sugar intake. I would definitely recommend it."

It is the answer to a healthy drink with absolutely no calories and just enough flavor to make spring water interesting without being overly sweet, plus a little fizz which I love!

1732,B006FUL4AE,A1F4FQAW2G9FRA,"James E. Jefferson, Jr. ""triggerman""",5,"This stuff is good and since I am a diabetic I don't need sugary drinks and really appreciate the flavor and quality.  I bought one from a local store and I'm hooked The best flavor for me are Lemonade , Pomegrante Berry, Lemon Lime and Black Raspberry"
1733,B006FUL4AE,A2VOUFMRYD2C3P,"B. Grage ""bgrage""",5,"Talking Rain Lemonade - even the name makes you think about thirst quenching, cool comfort and guilt-free (calories) lemonade !  With a slight effervescence, this bubbly, lightly (but fully) flavored lemon water is just the answer for a hot summer day as well as a bottled water that can easily replace my need for extra water for diet and after exercise.  Costing no more than any other plain water, this Talking Rain Lemonade is my number one ""go for"" drink !"
1734,B006FUL4AE,A15CO8Z1H9WNUY,MJWinter,5,"Crisp, light, and not overly sweet. Has a nice ""bite"" when swallowed. VERY refreshing and a great way to get your fluids in.  Someone wrote that if they had to choose a beverage to drink forever - aside from water - this would be just the thing. I second that! I have 2-3 dozen bottles shipped here per month. It's my FAVORITE Sparkling Ice flavor."
1735,B006FUL4AE,A3SNE08EPKAH3S,"Irish Patsy ""PJ""",5,"We LOVE this drink.  It has no calories, has anti-oxidants and contains vitamins and minerals and has less carbonation that most soft drinks.  It's a win-win, because it tastes so good and is refreshing.  We have cases of the lemonade and grapefruit shipped directly to our home as none of the stores in our small community sell Talking Rain ICE.  In addition, we buy five cases (18 bottles to a case) once a month from COSTCO when we are in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Those cases have three flavors (6 orange, 6 berry, 6 lemon-lime), but we love the lemonade and grapefruit so much that we pay to have them shipped to our home."
1736,B006FUL4AE,A2Q7SZKXS4R04W,Suzy q,5,I enjoy sparkling ice by Talking Rain. Discovered it for the first time in Florida.. It is in very limited supply where I live and many stores do not carry. It at all. Lemonade is VERY difficult to find.  It is crisp and refreshing. Love the carbonation and fruit balance!
1737,B006FUL4AE,A2RL1RS6PWUHWI,Jennifer Ackerman,5,"The Sparkling ICE brand is one of my favorite drink brands ever. I always thought I was craving sugar when I would reach for a soda instead of water (which wasn't often but often enough to make me hate myself for craving something so inherently unhealthy) but after realizing that it was the carbonation I was after, I quickly changed to these calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, and caffeine free) drinks instead. They are seriously so GOOD.<br /><br />And this lemonade flavor is by far my favorite. Many of the others are so strongly flavored (the pineapple one in particular) that you can't drink it with every type of meal (ie seafood, pasta, etc) which was annoying. This one though, I found I could. If I had to chose one drink that I had to drink for the rest of my life without ever having anything else, this would be a very close second behind water. It's THAT good.<br /><br />The only thing I would note is that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda doesn't bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can't help me to get him off his soda kick. So if you are also sensitive to Splenda, this isn't the product for you.<br />Comment"
1738,B006FUL4AE,A67SIFOG4RDK2,David626,5,This new Sparkling Ice Waters are fantastic.All the flavors are great.A much better alternative to diet sodas for diabatics.The price thru subscricption helps lower the price.
1739,B006FUL4AE,AVFA1JB08RG8G,"Wile E. Coyote ""^. .^""",3,"This lemonade flavor of Sparkling Ice was reasonably good. The lemon was not overly tart, but was a bit too sweet to suit me. On the down-side, this drink leaves a rather subtle -- yet distinct -- 'chemical' aftertaste. It's likely due to the added vitamins. I can't recommend this particular flavor, but I'd willingly accept it, if it were offered to me on a hot summer day."
1740,B000RHVG0O,A1JRIB8RLJS01V,Sassnee,3,"The question is ""what I would have liked to have known before I bought?"".<br />The answer would be what shape the seed was in...so in answer to that:<br />The seeds were not mildewey or moldy, you can use them, but they do<br />have abit of mustard seed (little black poppy looking seeds) and<br />a little tiny bit of seed refuse little tiny sticks and the such.  Not especially the best flax but certainly not the worse and the price really wasn't that bad. I will use in baking but not too keen on just eating it<br />straight, won't hurt you, just a personal thing."
1741,B0050CNFVE,ALCMFS34N368Y,W. P. Hawley,3,"These puff pops were very cute, but a little messy and not that great tasting. Great novelty item for a party though, people think it's pretty awesome!"
1742,B004138SWO,AQS3Z062MTX0L,A. Grossman,1,"A terrible disappointment. The fruit was slightly hard and flavorless. Only the apricots were edible. It was so bad that I threw the second tray away, not wanting to give it to anyone as a gift.  If only the fruit were like that in the picture."
1743,B007IBYOAG,ANM9NKBS2QQ6U,Christopher New,4,"The product description is a little sparse, so when I came back to re-order and saw there were still no reviews, I thought I would add some more information.<br /><br />First, as you probably guessed from the price, this is cinnamon burmanii, so it is not the most flavorful variety of cinnamon, and it is not really suitable for grinding.<br /><br />The product come in 3 individual sealed packages with a reusable zip-top seal, which is nice, because you don't need a container to store it in once it is opened.<br /><br />The main thing I use them in is to flavor coffee instead of sugar, and they work pretty decently for that.  For a normal, 6-oz cup of coffee, you only need a half of a stick.  They are pretty tough sticks though, I just switched to a 12-oz mug and I use a whole stick.<br /><br />They have a good cinnamon flavor, being more sweet than spicy, so if you are looking for spicier cinnamon you may way to keep looking.<br /><br />I experimented with steeping the cinnamon in the coffee before pouring it in the cup, but it seemed a little bitter when I did that.  You are better off putting it in right when you are ready to start drinking your hot beverage."

1746,B000LT0D4S,A2ERQV7XHB1AEO,"MrsBH ""MrsBH""",5,These candies are perfect for a quick freshen up after dinner. They don't stick between your teeth like the jelly filled ones that are similar. The flavor is light and refreshing. Perfectly sophisticated mints.
1747,B000LT0D4S,A2Y4S4CNGKF21S,H. Swanson,4,"I agree with the other reviewer who said these have a different texture than most - but I kind of like it. My obsession with pastel/after dinner mints is mostly because of the interesting texture and mild taste, and while these don't exactly melt in your mouth, they're still yummy. These also seem to have a different peppermint flavoring than most - very refreshing."

I realize that the description states 2.5"", however the picture makes the bones look like tightly knotted, ""normal"" sized bones - they are not. They are tiny, almost see-through and take up HALF the length of my palm, and are skinny. The pups devoured the entire bag in less then a week (they were given other treats as well.) I swear when I gave them the first one, they looked at me like ""are you kidding??"" Lesson learned. If you have a teacup breed, these are the bones for you (that is if teacup breeds even eat raw-hides)!!"

I have no idea why, but I'm really pissed about it because now my only option is to mail order it in bulk for 10x the price. The last thing I need is 12 chocolate bars sitting around in my kitchen; I'm fat enough as it is.<br /><br />Anyway, these bars taste exactly the same as milk chocolate, without the animal cruelty. Very creamy, so smooth. I only wish the company would make different flavors, like peanut bars, puffed rice bits, and ""chunky"" bars with cranberries and pecans..."
1753,B001DH6AFI,A1IFZ57IWYJ3J5,Andrew Chaplowitz,3,"The clever name is instructive: conventional chocoLATE--""latte"" refers to dairy-based.  So, for those trying to avoid dairy, this company uses rice milk. What is rice milk? Any grain can be made into a substitute milk by cooking the grain with at least 5x the amount of water, which will yield a milk-like substance after cooking.<br /><br />Also, it is sweetened with unrefined cane, which has some of the nutrients lost when refined into white sugar.  While not as optimal a sweetener as stevia or agave, it is less deleterious.<br /><br />In the end, this ricechoco has a taste very close to good chocolate, will not cause the mucuous-like symptoms that dairy-sensitive people experience, and will cause less of a ""sugar-rush-then crash"" when consuming conventional chocolate bars.<br /><br />a."
1754,B000W4U87E,A2PNOU7NXB1JE4,"Peggy ""pab920""",5,It is an accurate 8 ounce bottle of green and clear coarse sugar. The only downside is there is no sprinkler top.

I was so pleased to find that amazon is stocking Bob's yeast - not only is the price unbelievably good, but the quality is impressive as well.  If you plan on doing any baking in the future, I would highly recommend always having some of this in stock - it stores very well in the fridge for long periods of time, and the results can't be beat, especially for the price!"

Shipping and ""handling"" charges were Twenty dollars.  That would have been perfectly acceptable if they had used the money to actually package these properly instead of just make extra money like some infomercial.  The case arrived - all the cones packed in a single plastic bag within 1 box.  This box was in a larger shipping box.  The entire top and bottom rows were cracked to the point of rendering them unusable.  Several along both sides were also damaged.  On top of all that, they have almost no flavor whatsoever, even by wafer cone standards.  If you are looking for good cones, look elsewhere. [...] will send you mini sugar cones that are much more worth it."
1758,B0071LTQ4C,A3HSOHU5GPGL7P,"Angela DuBois ""Author, Classical education ad...",5,"These mini ice cream cones were just the ticket.  We dipped them in chocolate to make ""volcanoes"" for a Pompeii themed Halloween treat.  The packaging was more than adequate - not one cone was broken!  And the cones were substantial enough to stand up to warm melted chocolate without softening.  I will use this product at Christmas to make Christmas tree treats and would definitely recommend it."
1759,B0071LTQ4C,AKTEHF38GKIQF,No Name,5,"The cones were perfect size for what we had in mind.  They were in great condition when received, and were received earlier than expected.  Great product."

We used half of them to serve ice cream to all of the kids (mostly ages 5-7), and my aunt used the other half to make little cake balls dipped in chocolate that looked like little-ice cream cones.  The kids all loved them, and all of their moms were asking my aunt for the recipe for the ice cream cone cakes.  The cones are really cute, and were easier for the little kids to hold."
1761,B0071LTQ4C,A1206YTUEBDI0R,Goober,4,These cones were exactly what I needed.  Nowhere to be bought locally and this was a great find.  Like that you only buy a protion (not 1000).  Was hesitant seeing reviews about poor packaging and broken cones in shipping.  Well satisfied that they were very securly wrapped in celophane and then in bubble wrap. Original box placed in another box for shipping.  Arrived with only 1 chipped cone.

1764,B0071LTQ4C,A2W12P0PJLE0FB,Rachel Carpenter,3,"There is no excuse for bad packaging that causes the cones to be unusable, but the lack of taste works for using these little cones for edible containers for savory appetizers."

The matcha is the prominent flavor here, which is great since the matcha is of a good consistent quality, just like all of Red Leaf's matchas.  The bee pollen is a subtle flavor here, but that is fine since it's still tasty and extra super healthy!"
1766,B0076C1PYU,A3OGYXV9S7MJHM,Rita Lonie,4,"I bought this tea because when summer rolls around, I am a little puddle of miserable. Seriously, my allergies attack with everything they've got and there are days where I simply cannot go outside. Last summer, I discovered green tea seemed to help with some of the symptoms, as did local honey. So when I spotted Bee Pollen Matcha, I had to try it, if only to keep on hand for when I make smoothies all summer. Mmmm smoothies. A little frozen fruit, a splash of tea, and I am in heaven. This is why I bought a blender!<br /><br />This is most likely a case of mind over matter, but the first few sips of this tasted like honey to me. I don't know if it actually does, it's not overwhelmingly sweet, but it tastes a touch like honey. Kind of like how Honeybee from DavidsTea tastes like...well, how you imagine a bee would taste. All bzzzz and the like. But it is sweet enough and flavorful enough that while I was drinking it at work, I kept reaching for it. I tend to place my travel mug on the corner of the desk and forget it's there until I lose my voice.<br /><br />This matcha is also a good addition to my smoothies, since it provides calcium and protein. As someone on a dairy-free diet, the ability to get calcium in my tea is very important to me. A friend of mine says that ""drinking tea for the health benefits is like having sex for the exercise,"" but after a summer of allergies made manageable by local honey and green tea, I'm a believer. Do I think tea is going to magically make me skinner? No. Damn it. But I do firmly believe that teas like this matcha can help with things like allergies and vitamin deficiencies. If nothing else, this tea keeps me away from carbonated drinks like Coke and Dr. Pepper....mmm, Dr. Pepper. It also helps me cut back on sugary fruit juices and heart attack causing energy drinks. Matcha is all I need to get that rush to help me make it through my day. And this particular matcha is a tasty, tasty option. I love it!

Jones ""Bargain huntress""",5,"I will be buying this again,  it is a great tasting product and very handy for transporting and keeping for those times when you can't get to the store. Needs no refrigeration until it is opened, and once you do open it, it lasts for a long time in the refrigerator. My issues were with the expiration date. Mine expired about 2 months after I received it. There was no way that I could use 12 32oz cartons of this in that time--the very reason I bought it was because the description stated ""long shelf life."" Luckily, Amazon remedied the situation."
1774,B002B8ODPW,A28SJLPS7917GL,"J. Chickering ""Chicjulie""",5,"I hate running out of cream. You can store this cream unopened for months. Once opened it will last for a week or more. I would like the smaller containers, but this is great. Highly recommend it."
1775,B002B8ODPW,A189PLT2NGSY1E,B. Conway,4,"Two things I'd like to comment on...<br />First:<br />Reading the first reviewer's comment about the shelf life, I was concerned, but gambled on the purchase anyway.  While I did better than they did (they received their product with 2 months until it went beyond the code date), I only got 8 months.  Reading the description, it talks about being shelf stable for 13 months so I was robbed of the 5 months.<br /><br />Second:<br />I bought this primarily as cream for my coffee so I'm estimating that I'll use at most 2 Tablespoons per day (more on the weekend, but I generally only have two cups of coffee at home as I'm mostly drinking my daily coffee at work).  Each carton holds 64 Tablespoons.  So that means I'd use it up in 32 days.  However, each box is only good for 14 days once it's opened (although I'm guessing that's probably conservative).  With those numbers, I'll be throwing away half of each box.  Now I'm sure that I'll use the stuff in recipes here and there too, so my usage will increase somewhat but the long and short of it is that the boxes are just too darned big!  Come to think of it I can probably take some to work as I've got a small Tupperware container to carry it back and forth in, but still :(<br />Continuing with the math, if I use one box every two weeks, that means my supply of 12 boxes will be used up in just 24 weeks which puts my supply inside the 8 months shelf stable date this batch came with.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy, but BORDENS - PUSH TETRPAK (the packaging supplier) TO COME OUT WITH A CARTON THAT'S HALF THE CURRENT SIZE!!!!!!!!!!"
1776,B002B8ODPW,A2W661VQJVYZ9D,ghilliedhu1,1,"Very disappointed to discover that the expiration date for this ""long life"" product is in less than two months!  If you buy regular half and half at the store, it lasts about that long anyway.  There's no way we will be able to use up a whole case of this stuff in two months.  I think it is unethical for Amazon to sell products at full price this close to their expiration date.  What a waste of money!  I'm also disappointed to see that Amazon reduced their Subscribe and Save discount to 5% from 15% - very quietly, I might add.  I have been a regular customer for a very, very long time, but not sure that I will continue to be..."
1777,B002B8ODPW,AY1EF0GOH80EK,Natasha Stryker,2,"As for the taste of the product, it tastes just like evaporated whole milk to me.  It does not have the creamy mouth-feel of regular half-n-half.  I know that this is from treating it for long term shelf life, but I would not invest the money in it when you can get evaporated milk on sale quite often and it has a much longer shelf life.<br /><br />I ordered 2 boxes of this and one box was leaking so bad that FedEx would not deliver it.  The other appeared fine but inside had leaked everywhere and it took forever for me to find one container that wasn't leaking to try the product. The box was packed pretty good, the flat of cartons were wrapped in bubble wrap but with a bit of empty space in the box; so it is a 50/50 chance the cartons are just leaky or damage happened during shipping from shifting around in empty space during transit.<br /><br />Either way, Amazon customer service was wonderful about fixing the problem, but I will not be reordering."

I just knew when purchasing these that they had to be good keeping up with the Kirkland Signature name. This is a name I trust completely. and these looked interesting so I purchased them. I am so pleased with them and every one that had some says the same thing.I will purchase these again they are delicious.

There are 8 different types of candy in the jar (I am attaching a photo shows 4 of them which are representative). They look attractive and taste great! Most candies are rich  milk chocolate with differently flavored ganache inside the hard chocolate shell. Several of them have the rich chocolate ganache infused bit of different nuts. My favorites are the ones that use hazelnut. One of candies has ganache which has has a nice coffee flavor, another has a strong peanut flavor.<br /><br />Even though normally I prefer dark chocolate, I found that I really like this collection of chocolates and bought this jar many times at a local Costco store.  Costo prices this jar at 9.99 and brings out in the fall. This jar makes a nice option for Halloween and a nice yet inexpensive present at Christmas. I have used this jar at Yankee swap at work, and it was a big hit!<br /><br />Ali Julia review"

These are not gourmet chocolates anymore. I won't be buying these anymore.  The countries listed need to be revised.  United States is now one of the chocolate producers.  I'm guessing they are the cheaper, less tasty ones.  Oddly, Switzerland chocolates are last on the list, or the least amount you will get.<br />P.S.  These are only $9.99 at Costco."

1852,B0043ODAAG,A3AXB0V25VOSGS,JT,5,"I'm very active and a huge fan of coconut water and drink 1 or 2 cans a day (sometimes more).  I'm definitely aware of the carbon footprint that I'm leaving as I contribute to shipping coconut water around the world.  But for me, nothing beats coconut water when exercising or when i first wake up in the morning.... I admit my addiction.  I LOVE COCONUT WATER!!!<br /><br />A friend of mine told me about CocoHydro and i was skeptical at first.  I read about it on their website, it seemed like a noble idea coming from a good company, so I decided to order it.  To my surprise, I really like it!  I would have ordered the Original flavor, yet Amazon was out of stock (i've backordered), so I ordered the Pineapple.  It is really good!  Pretty authentic flavor and I can definitely feel it hydrating my body.  It's in my water bottle when I'm on my bike and it works great!  I do look forward to trying the Original flavor, as that will be the determining factor for my ultimate opinion on this product.<br /><br />I do add more of the powder than is recommended on the instructions, as i like a stronger flavor.  I also add a pinch of salt, as I like more salt when I exercise.<br /><br />This is definitely going to be a staple in my kitchen and water bottle!  Its much cheaper than buying cans of coconut water.<br /><br />While nothing beats a fresh coconut cracked open, sitting on the beach of Costa Rica, waiting for the perfect wave to come in, this is a great alternative for us coconut water addicts in North America.<br /><br />I support it."
1853,B0043ODAAG,A1MVZMBVCRYK9S,amaranthiness,5,"Potassium punch in a pouch - an envelope of electrolytes - this stuff is awesome.  I love my coconut water daily and was horrified at the waste I was responsible for as a result.  This product is going to be my new favorite regular amazon purchase until I can find it in my local stores.  The flavor is fantastic (as is the plain - sadly for me I had to knock a star off the Pom-Ras), the dissolvability great, and the convenience can't be beat.  Thank you Big Tree boys - for making the precious nectar accessible and affordable!"
1854,B0043ODAAG,A2K2WTFXJXH4QT,Ronald D Chan,4,"Good for rehydrating after a workout. The taste of the powder isn't very strong, so if you're looking for something with significant flavor, you'll have to use a lot. Two heaping spoonfuls for a full glass of water is what I'll use. The pineapple flavor tastes like faintly sweetened pineapple, not like coconut water, so if you like the taste of coconut water and that's what you're looking for, I'd get the original flavor instead. For a flavor blast, try mixing this into orange juice. It's DELICIOUS."
1855,B0043ODAAG,A3UF4K552BJ1VC,Happy Rafters,4,This is the best tasting one from CocoHydro. Low in sugar and carbs. Make it a little on the strong side to get the full flavor. Will buy again.
1856,B0043ODAAG,ALSL8MUJUY6SN,David Walker,5,"I drink coconut water because it is so delicious. But since most of the canned/packaged stuff is so expensive, I tried this product. IT IS GOOD! I like this even more than the original, which tastes exactly like regular coconut water. The pineapple is a good addition, not too strong, just right. I mix it 2 spoonfuls into 16oz of cold water, stir vigorously for about 20 seconds. DRINK. ENJOY."
1857,B0043ODAAG,A2VETEKM4OLSG7,B. Pelser,4,"I was kind of skeptical, but I really do like this powdered version. The pineapple taste is nice and, in the right amount of water, it dissolves completely. Not as good as fresh, but portable and tasty. I am curious to try the plain version. I'll always keep some on hand for a quick electrolyte boost, especially when traveling. Try it!"
1858,B0043ODAAG,AMBP43LPGG1UD,Bethany,3,My children and I did not care for the taste of the drink.  I like the idea of the drink but not the taste.  I will have to try other flavors.
1859,B0043ODAAG,A2KTJRYV9FUXTD,Oscar Girl,2,I have tried several coconut water brands and this one was way too salty. I tried to adjust the water to CocoHydro ratio but still salty.
1860,B0043ODAAG,A3HK89L8QRWJ6,2MuchCoffee (AA),3,"Much better than the regular flavor (which has a stale cheese aftertaste). Still, not really any coconut flavor, but at least the pineapple flavor is well balanced and it has no cheesy aftertaste."

It had a weird bitter taste that I did not like.  As far as baking with it, my baked goods came out looking great, but not tasting as sweet as I wanted them to.  Also, the product does not measure cup for cup to sugar so you need to use more.  For one cup of sugar, you need to use 1.75 cups of Just Like Sugar.  So product is used fast, it is expensive, and not readily available like other sweeteners."

Definitely going to keep in my pantry :)"
1868,B003O6YWHE,A2IHMALRCEME5,D. Kloss,5,"I have switched to Just Like Sugar in my low-carb, sugar free baking.  This product works beautifully.  There is no funky aftertaste and no digestive upset with Just Like Sugar.  I highly recommend it."
1869,B003O6YWHE,A1P4BZJXU48DRZ,SuzyQ,5,"I use Just Like Sugar in baking and to sweeten my coffee and tea.  There is not the overwhelming sweetness of sucrose here, but it's to be expected and I'm not surprised by it.  I actually prefer a milder level of sweetness, and this product perfectly sweetened my homemade brownies, a wonderful compliment to the unsweetened chocolate I used.  I will use the white baking Just Like Sugar in all of my recipes, but avoid the Brown variety whose acrid aftertaste I could not tolerate.  The white is a winner, and so powdery fine that I don't need to put in a blender so that it will properly dissolve in mixtures, as I've had to do with other sugar substitutes on the market.  No digestive concerns noted.  The fiber in this sugar seems to be well tolerated. Will definitely be purchasing more."

Upon contacting them, Customer Service of the Vendor reacted immediately; they sent me the brown sugar and a pre-paid envelope with which to return the extra baking product.  I cannot comment on the product--haven't used it yet; but I can definitely vouch for the fact that this company is responsive.<br /><br />I thought the price was a bit high and a 9 dollar shipping charge was excessive for A three pound shipment--but, Hey, the proof is in the pudding.  I don't mind the price if it is as good as it claims to be (I tasted a bit of the brown sugar when it arrived and it certainly had the flavor).

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""",5,"""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" is one of the healthiest and tastiest foods you have available at your local grocery. When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what wheat germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and provides an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects.<br /><br />Since 1982, I have incorporated ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows:<br /><br />1] Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture.<br /><br />2] Substituting wheat germ for bread crumbs in meatloaf, veal/ chicken cutlets, or any fried batter.<br /><br />Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged.<br /><br />This ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO!<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: This 12 ounce package costs only $1.00 less than the 20-ounce package and should be passed by when the 20-ounce size is available. Sometimes the 20-ounce size is out of stock or absent from store shelves so check first."

1901,B0002ZILVI,AY15XZG8JA5IY,omgvalk,3,"Our husky began teething, and we decided we needed to get her something to chew on apart from socks, underwear, and furniture as all of these were apparently more interesting than her toys. Embedded flavor seemed like it would be great to keep her interest, and it did. We supervised her carefully and she never broke off pieces larger than a grain of rice. Diarrhea was an almost immediate result and took her 3 days to recover. While the product itself seems great (she loved it, it kept her busy, and was fairly durable), it's definitely not something to give to a dog with a sensitive tummy."

1903,B0002ZILVI,A31YSB7ZVW5AQ3,Star,3,"My puppy has had a couple of these bones, and I don't recommend them. She can chew the ends of them down quite quickly (and she isn't a large breed puppy), so I can only let her have one for ten or fifteen minutes at a time if I want it to last longer than a few days. The Nylabone puppy fish toys are a few dollars more, but are more durable and have lasted much longer."

I recently found this product and recommend it highly.<br /><br />One teabag makes a large pitch of this pleasant, mild tea.  It's taste reminds me a bit of Sugar Smacks without the sugar, or even Sheerios.  Doesn't sound like a good taste for tea you say?  Well, you'd be suprised.  A co-worker who tasted it said it reminds her of coffee, which I can see too.<br /><br />Recent studies have shown it has many health benefits, including the ability to improve the fludity of the blood.  I'm not sure how that translates into overall well being, but I know that drinking it makes me feel healthy, and I enjoy the flavor.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea (sorry, had to), but it is worth trying at least once I'd say.  I have a container at work and I sip iced Barley tea throughout the day."
1906,B0002BKIRW,A133T07WO5KYX3,Charlotte A. Hu,5,"The idea of boiling grain to make a tea never occurred to me.  Surprisingly in Seoul, many restaurants serve barley tea, called bori-cha as their standard free beverage.  Most of my Korean colleagues love it.  It is a kind of cultural icon.  Growing up with Honey nut Cheerios, I assumed that barley needs honey, so I added honey to my barley tea and it is to die for.  My Korean colleagues consider this sacrilege, but I still recommend it.<br /><br />Barley tea is also popular in Japan and Ecuador.  Apparently, we are behind in the discovery of this wonderful tea.<br /><br />The taste of barley tea is a bit like regular tea, say Lipton, but softer.  Most importantly for me, this tea is healthy and natural.  I don't drink coffee, black or green tea for health and personal reasons.  Tea made from barley is healthy, refreshing and enjoyable.  You must try some."
1907,B0002BKIRW,A1KUTOAFODEG3Z,Elaine,5,"If you like mugicha (barley tea), this stuff is great, and super easy! The teabags are pitcher-sized, so all you have to do is drop it in a pitcher of water and refrigerate it overnight, and you're done. (Use filtered water -- it makes a big difference.) I like it plain and think it tastes slightly sweet by itself, but I know people like to add sugar to it, too. Since it's caffeine free and calorie free and really refreshing when cold, it makes a great alternative to plain water for staying hydrated in the summer. I keep boxes of this stuff in my pantry all summer. My local Asian Supermarket also carries this product."
1908,B0002BKIRW,A3I6704DLTIILE,powerop,5,"This is just how I remember drinking barley tea for the first time in Shinjuku, Japan. This tea tastes just as great and brings back memories for me. It has a toasty nuttiness flavor, similar to dandelion tea but more light and refreshing. Says you can steep in cold water, but I enjoy it by putting one tea bag in my coffee maker and brewing it that way. Makes a wonderful morning coffee replacement. Individual tea bags are larger than normal, each making 1 qt of tea (equivalent to 4 cups or 2 water bottles). I drink lots of healthy tea (moringa, dandelion, green tea, white tea, oolong), and this one of my favorites!<br /><br />I find placing one tea bag into my coffemaker is so convenient for me as it is enough to fill a 10 cup carafe with strong flavor within minutes (not watered down and faster than cold steeping). For any left over hot tea, I let it cool down to room temperature and place it in the fridge for a refreshing drink anytime. My highest recommendation for this tea is using clean, great tasting water as it really makes a difference.<br /><br />I only see one ingredient listed on the box: Barley. Manufactured by House Foods Corp in Tokyo, Japan. Hope this helps."
1909,B0002BKIRW,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""",5,"After having a great experience with barley tea, I figured that I needed to find some bags to brew up my own tea. (It'd be cheaper, that's for sure.) What initially drew me to this brand was that the instructions are in English, which is something that is not guaranteed with each brand out there on Amazon. If you are new to brewing, this is will be easy for you to understand.<br /><br />The teabags are sealed up in foil packets, with many bags in one packet, so depending on how long you'll go between usages you might want to put the remaining bags in the foil packet in a ziplock. (I know that some are especially sensitive to the difference in taste that comes from teabag containers being left open.) Each bag can be used to make 1 quart of tea.<br /><br />This tastes pretty good and I loved how easy it was to make. You can either brew it with hot water or leave it in the refridgerator to brew in cold water. It's rather fast when it comes to steeping, so I was able to enjoy the tea after a few hours in the fridge.<br /><br />I'm absolutely going to purchase this again when I head back to my local Asian food market."

My youngest son talked me into trying some Mugicha Tea at our Family Christmas get-to-gether.  I fell in love with it imediately.  We had a quart of the tea with sugar.  He adds way too much sugar, but the flavor was great.  He had made two quarts of non-sweetened which I tried last.  Result:  Just as great and also left no aftertaste.  It was soothing, and quenching.  I will be ordering this from my local store once I find the one that carries it.  Again, GREAT DRINK."
1911,B0002BKIRW,A3B1A370MNIZSV,J. Matters,4,"I go out for Korean food rather frequently, so I've become accustomed to the flavor of ice-cold barley tea. But, I will be honest: it took a few tries. It's very different from the types of tea you might be used to.<br /><br />Anyway, I recently bought this House brand from an Asian supermarket because it doesn't require any boiling. Simply fill a pitcher with water, throw in a bag, and come back in an hour or so.  The taste is just what I was expecting: mellow and earthy, without any bitter aftertaste. It suggests one bag for a quart of water, but it will make 2 quarts just fine.<br /><br />I give 4 stars not because of any flaws. The tea was fine in every way. But, there was really nothing to make it worthy of 5 stars. I imagine one day I'll find a Barley Tea that gives something extra, which elevates the medium with its subtlety and tone. But, House brand is quite good, and perfectly refreshing."

I leave the bag tea in the water in the fridge over the night. In the morning I drink it with coconut milk. It fills me up for a while.

They didn't always have it on the menu because of the brewing process taking so much time.  I loved that tea. When they had it on hand, I ordered two very large containers of it.<br /><br />Recently, I read about Barley tea bags, the House-Mugicha Barley Tea, in particular.  So, I found it and ordered it from Amazon,some for me and some for a friend of mine.<br /><br />The order was filled before the estimated time of delivery for both of us.  Well, she loves it and so do I.  Tastes just like that tea I liked in the Japanese restaurant only, I brew it anytime I like.<br /><br />It's so easy.  I just put one bag in a nearly two gallon jug, fill it with cold filtered water and place it in the fridge overnight.<br /><br />I plan to order more from Amazon too and so does my friend.  She is supposed to drink more water and the Barley tea helps her to do just that.<br /><br />Note: This kind of tea has many health benefits besides just tasting good.  The Japanese have been drinking it for centuries for good health.  And... it will cool down the body nicely during a hot Summer day."

However the vet office, Pet Smart, Wal-Mart, any many local retail stores don't carry this particular Fresh n' Clean product. Very hard to find. Well if there is one thing we dog owners love...its to have a clean fresh scented dog for more than a few days.

The shampoo and cream rinse bottles last about a year and I'm generous with it. I  wash my dogs about every 2 months because it isnt easy washing 2shepards. The cream rinse is the real gem. I usually buy 2 rinses to one shampoo. It will make your dog smell good for 2 weeks just like it claims. Sometimes, on week 3 or 4 after a bath I take a hot wet towel and put the rinse on it and towel them off for another 2 weeks of good smelling dogs. They actually like it.  It's kind of like wrestling and petting them. They think I'm playing. They try to take the towel.  In the end they smell good.  However recently I couldn't find it anywhere. So I googled it and found like everything else, amazon sells it.  My dogs don't have allergies and the rinse doesn't make them itch despite the generous amount of perfume. It is engineered to bond to their hair and not wear off before 2 weeks and it works!"

It is very, very easy to make, and meal-time has become a big deal in my house -- they all sit with wagging tails as I prepare it. When I stayed at my mom's house for a couple weeks, her two dogs were much more interested in having my dogs' food than their own regular dog food. I originally bought this food because I wanted to put my dogs on a vegan diet. For the protein source, I use tofu and all sorts of beans like chickpeas/garbanzo beans, black beans, etc. They love it no matter what I add to it. I rotate the type of oil I use, or sometimes I use a blend. When I first put them on this food, I used the serving size they recommend, and my dogs started gaining weight. So I am actually able to use less than what they say in the instructions. I have three 50-pound dogs and I use approximately 1 scoop per dog, twice a day. In the 10-lb bag there are about 198 scoops, in the 5 lb bag there are around 99 scoops, in the 20 oz bag there are around 24 scoops. So from that you should be able to calculate a good estimate of the cost for your dog(s). Of course for smaller dogs you can use less. With my finicky dog, I used to have to stand over him and goad him into eating his commercial dog food (which even contained meat). Now he scarfs his food every time! One other note: I sometimes add some Nature's Recipe Vegetarian formula dry dog food just to add some crunch. For vegetarian/vegan treats, I feed them Sam's Yams and C.E.T. VeggieDent. It is a wonderful thing to be able to give my dogs a cruelty-free diet! And we never have to worry about all those crazy dog food recalls!"

The texture wasn't too bad, not the usual prepackaged gluten-free grainy texture. My husband went Gluten-Free when I had to, he almost almost anything and he doesn't like them either. We tried them plain, with cream cheese, with cream cheese/olives, in salad, with cheddar cheese, nacho cheese but nothing would conceal the after-taste, in my opinion they were Horrible! I would say it is just my taste buds but...I not 1 of my 5 kids, 4 of which will eat pretty much anything, liked these. We offered them to friends, family, and neighbors but after trying them no one would take them. It could be possible that we purchased a bad batch, there were 2 packages in the box, but I don't think we want to chance buying and wasting another box.

This product also contains a small amount of powdered honey (a little over 2 grams to get to the 10 calorie stick).  It is not marked as to where it is made(would be 5 star if marked-- I am picky).<br /><br />Mango Pinapple is one of the varieties that contains caffeine, Strawberry Acai is decaffeinated."

I over dilute mine (using 1 pouch to a 24 oz bottle) and it is still a little too sweet for me.  Hubby likes it the way it is supposed to be and of course, the kids will drink it any way you give it to them.  It is a better alternative on the go than buying soda or sugary beverages.  A nice alternative when we are tired of drinking plain water, etc.  Honestly, there are not a lot of ""healthier"" to go options that you can leave in the car or a bag.  Hopefully, there will be soon."

It is strong, so one packet does two glasses, but it is very expensive.  Part of me wonders how much different it is vs. a tin of iced tea powder mix.  All in all, its ok, but I would save the money and buy in bulk unless you absolutely need the packets."
1951,B007I7Z3Z0,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,Graves,3,"I was unsure how ""Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix"" would taste, I was interested but also a little leery. I decided to wait until I was in need of `refreshment' and not just a `drink.' Over the weekend I was working in the garden, came in and decided this was the time it was designed for.<br /><br />I poured a glass of water, added the powder and stirred. And stirred, and stirred again. The powder clumped a bit and took some work to break up. I took a small sip and mainly tasted the artificial sweetener. Not so good. I took the plunge and took a big swallow. That was rather better. It tasted of tea and the hint of honey and fruit. Not bad, I down the rest of the glass in two goes and was pleasantly surprised. Not bad.<br /><br />Then trouble creeped in as the main flavor ended and the taste of the artificial sweetener filled my mouth in the aftertaste. I do not make a habit of drinks with artificial sweetener and this aftertaste was the reason why. BLEAH.Since my wife is no stranger to diet soda's I asked her to give it a try. She had the exact same problems I did with the powder clumping badly and an even strong reaction to the aftertaste.<br /><br />In the end when you're downing it this is a nice, refreshing drink, BUT if you are not in the habit of `diet' drinks the aftertaste will be an unpleasant and unwelcome surprise."
1952,B007I7Z3Z0,A1H6JP5UC5WVT7,Edward Durney,3,"With this tea mix, Lipton is trying too hard to make a simple taste memorable. Adding honey, mango and pineapple tastes to green tea is a mishmash, not a recipe. While the mix is drinkable, its complicated flavors detract rather than add to the result."
1953,B007I7Z3Z0,A28TWWUAWFVCTR,Never pay retail,4,"This completely reminds me of Kool-Aid.  Pretty sweet, no particular green tea taste.  I appreciate that I can have something this sweet and refreshing without a ton of calories or caffeine.  The granules take forever to dissolve so it is best used in a water bottle you can shake rather than a glass you have to stir.  I notice they've added a pitcher sized pack to the single serve lines which I assume would be more cost effective."
1954,B007I7Z3Z0,A2GPJR489OIH42,sb-lynn,3,"On the plus side, the tea mixed fairly easily without any residue remaining on the bottom - stirring with a spoon in a glass is adequate. That was important to me since convenience and ease in making it are part of what makes me want to buy it. I thought it was very sweet and refreshing, and my husband enjoyed it.<br /><br />On the negative side, it was almost too sweet for me, but if you add more water (obviously) that helped. What I couldn't change was the taste itself, and I thought there was a bit of an ""aftertaste"".  I don't know whether or not it's just because I just don't like the taste of the acai, which I've never had before.  I think I would have preferred just the strawberry. But if you are a fan of acai I would say you should try this and it may end up being ""your cuppa tea""."

Small packets of Strawberry Acai flavored tea that is simple to use and provide a great tasting beverage.  Simply pour the stix into a bottle of water and shake well, or pour into a glass and stir well.  Drink and enjoy: pretty simple concept that is well known.<br /><br />At 5 calories and 1 gram of sugar, it is a reasonable substitute for other drinks.  Plus, it is decaffeinated, so that is a big plus.<br /><br />The flavor is definitely strawberry.  I am not sure what acai tastes like, but I could not taste any other flavor than strawberry.  So if you are looking for a strong tea flavor, this is not the flavor for you.  It tastes more like diluted juice than tea for sure.<br /><br />I really like this product and will gladly buy it again. A note, be sure to stir or shake well, as the box notes tea takes longer to dissolve."

I should have been thinking ""Oh boy, tastes like raspberry jello and I can DRINK it"". Don't get me wrong, it tastes alright for what it is . Just don't get your mouth all puckered up for tea because there isn't much tea taste to it.  The person who came up with the idea of adding sucralose should be fired. Maybe that was their way of competing with all the no-calorie, low-calorie ""water enhancers"" on the market but I think they will lose more customers with the sucralose than they would with a few more calories. But what do I know?<br /><br />Anyway, a description of the product. The box comes with 10 little packets about the size of a stick of gum. Easy to carry in your pocket or purse. Each packet flavors 16 oz of water.  Each packet has a little slit making it easy to open and an opening just the right size to empty  it into a bottle.  Dissolves quickly. Decaf ,if that's important to you.<br /><br />The ""GO Stix"", in water,  were a little too strong for my taste but I emptied one into a 2 quart pitcher of Lipton iced tea and it gave it a very nice, subtle strawberry taste. I think that is the way I'll be using mine. Not what they were intended for ,I know , but works for me."
1957,B007I7Z3Z0,A3HAA7H8PBVM78,Joseph Oppenheim,4,"I like the drink. It doesn't taste like tea, though. It has a fruity, red in color, taste with a slight after taste probably from the sucralose. I would prefer the drink without the artificial sweetener(s). The drink is already sweetened with honey and if still not sweet enough, I would prefer to add a little sugar if needed. But, the drink is good and low calorie, so a decent trade-off. Also, the mix dissolved easily in the water."
1958,B007I7Z3Z0,A235NA61RC6YC1,George Dionne,4,"Lipton has another winner on their hand with their new on the go honey, strawberry acai iced green tea packets.  You get all the health benefits of the green tea as well as 5 calories per serving.  I have found with most low calorie tea you lose a lot of flavor, but this one has all the sweetness you crave without the guilt.  More fruity tasting than tea tasting, but still worth it."

Unlike most other Texans, however, I prefer my tea unsweetened most of the time. So, the Lipton was a little too sweet for my taste. Even knowing that it was honey flavored, I didn't expect it to be as sweet as it is. As a comparison, I like the Lipton Citrus Green Tea in bottles, but it is right on the edge. This was maybe twice as sweet. However, the mango flavor was excellent. Over ice, this tea was great."

But, this one is really good. It's not as much green tea as it is mango and pineapple. If you're a tea lover, you might not like this so much. It's very fruity.  I like the fact that it's not all artificially sweetened even though it does contain an artificial sweetener.  At least there is some honey in it.  I would definitely buy these.  I couldn't keep them away from my daughters and my wife."

While I liked the Strawberry Acai flavor in and of itself, I did NOT like the after taste left behind. It uses sucralose as a sweetener and I just don't like the ""coating of the tongue"" effect you get from that. I don't drink diet beverages normally, so I might just be more sensitive to the sucralose. I suppose if you are one who drinks diet beverages normally you would probably not notice the after taste that most diet beverages leave. I would love if they made this product with real sweeteners and not artificial."

But, these little iced tea things make the cut!  They dissolve easily, even at the office without a spoon to use to stir and the flavor is light and sweet, not cloying and artificial.  I do use a bit more water than the package recommends, but I find this product pleasing and excellent!"

They come in a couple different flavors and are a nice to change up to the old routine.  The honey, strawberry acai is tasty.  Quite different than several of the other packets I've tried.  If you are looking for a way to drink more water without the caffeine, these are terrific.  Many of the tea varieties of other brands contain caffeince, but these are decaf.  They do contain some artificial sweetner which I would prefer to not have, but the flavor doesn't have a strong aftertaste and it does limit the calories.  I would definitely recommend giving these a try."

Unlike other brands where you can just pour water over the powder and it'll mix itself and dissolve, this stuff needs to be stirred and stirred and stirred, and you'll still end up with random clumps of unmixed powder anyway. The flavor is pretty good, but as others have said, there's no real honey taste. It tastes more like a sugar-free Crystal Light mix. Not that is a bad thing, but it's not the flavor it says it should be."

Lipton Tea & Honey, Decaffeinated Iced Green Tea Mix, Strawberry Acai (how's that for a memorable name) does have ""decaffeinated green tea powder"" in the list of ingredients, third behind honey granules (sugar honey) and something called ""malic acid.""<br /><br />Perhaps that's why this product, which is low calorie (5 calories per every 8 ounce serving) and convenient (just add water to the ""to go"" packet, and shake), doesn't real have an iced tea taste. The taste is pleasant enough, and this product definitely tastes okay (it has a strawberry taste), but sorry, it's not iced tea.<br /><br />Te good news is that this product is non-fat, and very low calorie. And the packets are very convenient, which is great if you are looking for a low calorie, non-fat soda replacement at work or school. It's just not iced tea."

1968,B007I7Z3Z0,ADB8XCKNSDY5Z,theboombody,4,"I really like the taste of this drink. It tastes like a smooth fruit juice. I was expecting it to taste like a flavored tea, but it's more of a flavored fruit juice. I do like the health quality of it. And being that it is caffeine free, it is great for my whole family, my 5 year old loves it as much as his kool-aid, so this makes a great alternative! I would recommend it if you're looking for a fruity tasting drink, just don't expect it to taste like tea.<br />Also, it dissolved quickly. Some ""tea"" mixes tend to sit at the top of my bottle, this did not."
1969,B007I7Z3Z0,ABLV9L4MQO7ER,Matthew R. Kuiper,3,"I love the concept of a mixture in a small packet form that you can add to water in order to transform the taste. I know many companies have embraced this idea and have branched out from juices to coffee and I think it is a good direction to take. A few of these packets in the side pocket of my bag provides a convenient way to have my own beverage when I want it without the danger of a flask or a bottle spilling on your stuff.<br />This concept I give 5 stars and will gladly purchase more in the future.<br />However, as far as taste goes Lipton has sold out to the sugary sweet guys. Lipton's Iced Green Tea Mix really is more like Kool-Aid fruit punch. For my tasting preference, a 20 oz bottle of water is not enough water for one of these packets. I ended up using half of a packet for 20 oz of water. Using more water with the packet brings out the tea in the drink which is normally hidden by the sugar sweetness in the 20oz water.<br />If Lipton calms down the sweetness level in the packet I would definitely purchase again. It isn't very practical to use only half of the package per beverage."

The label says each packet is 2 servings, so most people will use the entire thing and have 10 calories. The to-go packets make it easy to keep in your purse. The packets say it is sweetened with honey, but it also contains sucralose (the generic for Splenda), so I think the label is a little misleading. I liked the strawberry flavor and it didn't have a strong diet after-taste, although I could tell it had artificial sweetener. I like that it doesn't contain artificial colors. If you like other green tea beverages, I highly recommend this one.

1972,B007I7Z3Z0,A2J8T58Z4X15IO,ScOObydoo,4,"The instant beverage market has exploded in recent years - what started with Kool-Aid is now half an aisle at the local grocery store. Products like Mio and these Lipton packets are brilliant to have ""on the road"". This newest flavor from Lipton is pretty creative, and shows that companies are slowly running out of the basics. The flavor of the tea, honey, mango pineapple is good - the ingredients list is pretty decent (no propolyne Glycol like in Mio for example). One packet is enough to flavor a regular bottle of water, and factoring in the price of both, this makes a pretty cheap flavored water.<br /><br />That said, there is also something to be said for sticking to normal unflavored water, but lets be honest - everyone needs some flavor every now and then."
1973,B007I7Z3Z0,A3MUSWDCTZINQZ,"Ulalume Jones ""Creative Gal""",4,"This tea tastes a bit like strawberry jam to me.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  I tried dissolving it in both a glass of cold water and shaking it in a plastic water bottle. Both ways produces a good blend of the product with little or no powder left.  I already finished my box, so that is a testament to how refreshing it is. It's a good substitution for soda or if you want something treat-like in your water."
1974,B007I7Z3Z0,A3GM64N13BILUP,Ron Cole,4,"Lipton Tea & Honey Strawberry Acai is an individually-packaged drink sweetener that you add to water in order to improve the flavor. It is decaffeinated, which I especially like, and is pretty simple to use: tear off the top, pour it into a bottle of water, and shake it up until the powder is completely dissolved. What you get is a refreshing, low calorie (10 calorie if you use the entire packet) drink that is an alternative to cola and plain water.<br /><br />Overall, the product has a decent flavor, and you can definitely taste the honey and strawberry. I do, however, have two problems with it. First, the box states the product is ""made with real ingredients,"" yet it contains the artificial sweetener sucralose (which is marketed under the trade name Splenda). The use of sucralose in no way invalidates the other ""real"" ingredients like tea leaves and strawberries, but it also means that not every ingredient in the drink is *natural* (something people often infer when the term ""real"" is used). Second, each packet contains enough for TWO bottles of water - if you pour the whole packet into one bottle, it will probably be significantly too sweet.<br /><br />Rating: 4 out of 5 stars. I liked the flavor overall, and will use it in the future. It is a valid alternative to diet cola, and has a more natural flavor than many other water sweeteners on the market."
1975,B007I7Z3Z0,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Stanley  C. Sargent ""Stanley C. Sargent""",4,"This product does taste good, and it only contains 5 calories from 1 gram of sugar. It takes 2 or 3 minutes to completely dissolve, but that's not a problem. What is confusing/questionable are some of the ingredients. Among others listed are ""sucralose (sweetner), Maltodextrin (corn), ... isomalt"". What are these things? Two of them appear to be malt products and the other an artificial sweetner. Is this Maltodextrin (corn) similar to high fructose corn syrup?<br /><br />Also, at the very bottom of the ""Nutrition Facts"", apart from the ingredients list, 10 mg of caffeine per 8 fl oz serving (2 servings/packet"" is also mentioned. When only 1/2 packet (one serving per the package) is added to 8 fluid ounces of water, the taste is definitely watered down."
1976,B007I7Z3Z0,A1LAGS8H4A2DR7,Bill Nicholas,4,"A while back I tested a couple of flavors of Mio and found them to be one dimensional and disturbingly artificial. On one hand, while I usually brew my own ice tea for daily drinking, I don't always have it and sometimes would like a substitution. Mio isn't it. Lipton To Go Stix are an improvement over Mio. Mio tends to only hit parts of your tongue's taste buds and lacks a balance and fullness of flavor, in addition to tasting fake. Real brewed iced tea has a broad spectrum of flavors that cover a wide range of taste buds while highlighting the flavors you brew it for. In my case, I make cold brewed green tea with honey and I can actually taste the green tea and honey. With tea drink mixes, though, I rarely taste the tea. Most are overly sweet for me. The Lipton To Go Stix, however, when mixed as directly, is not overbearing in sweetness or any one flavor. I still don't taste ice tea, but the other flavors taste like they are supposed to and it covers a wider range of tastebuds. It does not taste artificial. The 7 ingredients include flavors from natural sources (honey, sugar, green tea powder, hibiscus) versus Mio's mostly synthesized formulas.<br /><br />On the whole, I think I may pick up some of these To Go Stix if I see them on sale. I think Lipton did a good job of creating natural flavors and it may fit the bill as a substitute drink for me."

However I did enjoy the Lipton Honey Mango Pineapple Ice Tea, albeit with a few caveats.<br /><br />I enjoyed the flavor, and didn't find it too ""chemically"" or with a significant aftertaste. It is sweet, but not overpoweringly so (depending on how you mix it). However, I found that following the mixing instructions of the box made the tea far too strong and sweet. I'd recomend starting with half the listed amount, and adding from there to taste.<br /><br />Although some people have stated that this is ""all natural"", do be aware that it contains sucralose, an artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the tea, but I would like it much more if it were a bit less sweet, and really were all natural."

The fruit flavor doesn't really taste like a juice, either. It's very good, but I do wish it tasted more like an herbal-green tea mix with less sweetness.  My kids disagree. They like the flavor and its sweetness just the way it is.  I prefer to drink it diluted to half-strength, so instead of pouring the whole pouch into my 16 oz. water bottle or glass, I pour in half of it.  Or I get my 32 oz. water jug and pour the whole pouch into that.<br /><br />Other than the fact that it doesn't taste like tea at all, the other small complaint I have is that the powder doesn't fully dissolve.  There are always a few small dark pink balls floating around, no matter how much I stir or shake it.  I just tell myself it's little pieces of fruit and go ahead and drink it.  I have noticed that they do dissolve by the time I finish the drink, if I manage not to swallow them down.<br /><br />This is a great flavor additive if you are trying to drink more water, but just can't bring yourself to drink it plain.  It should be noted that it does contain caffeine and artificial sweeteners."

Nothing seems to really jump out and make me reach for it eagerly; and a lot of them end up reminiscent of Tang in different flavors.<br /><br />Lipton's new Tea and Honey Mango Pineapple is a break from the norm. There is a lot of flavor here, and a lot of satisfaction in its qualities. The honey and fruit combines to deliver a refreshing, good-tasting drink that makes me want another right away.<br /><br />One slight caveat: as with all drinks including artificial sweeteners (sucralose; 5 calories per packet) there is a mild aftertaste.

I tried one of the Green Teas sweetened with Honey by Lipton & was pleasantly surprised. So I decided to give this flavor a try as well. It's not as good as the Green Tea. Obviously, the tea is very artificial tasting, not like their bottled tea. It's powdered instant tea though so I it's to be expected. However, after a few sips, it grew on me. The fruitiness is there but not over powering. The packaging is very convenient. I can just throw one in my purse and pour it into a 16 oz. bottle of water wherever I am.

I can't imagine it being quite so refreshing if you're wrapped up in a quilt huddling by a fire.<br /><br />The little to-go pack took me a while to figure out how to open. That cut they put in it almost looked like a mistake rather than the way you're actually supposed to open the thing.<br /><br />Watering it down might spread out the taste a bit. I'm more of a raspberry/blueberry sort of girl, but this is a pleasant diversion. If you like green tea you should give this a shot."

The tea was tasty and refreshing.  I really tasted the green tea and the mango; the pineapple and the honey, not so much. the label states that the powder would take a little time to dissolve, but I didn't find that to be the case.  My only complaint is that te individual packets call for 16.9 bottles of water. I don't always have that size. I would like to see this in a 1 or 2 quart envolope, or a canister. Let me determine how much I wish to make. Would buy again. No artificial chemical sweetner taste."

It even has a nice pomegranate smell when you pour it in.<br /><br />One stick makes 8 fl oz, but I actually used one stick for a regular glass, which is about 16 fl oz and found it to be strong enough for my tastes. There were some little chunks that didn't mix up all the way - I made this in a glass with ice and cold water. I expect you wouldn't have that problem if you were using a water bottle and shaking it up.<br /><br />I'd buy this again, or order it again if I got it as a drink in a restaurant."

After trying some other products, I realized this is probably the green tea.  Once I got used to it, I found I quite liked it.  This drink is very refreshing and does not fill me up like a carbonated drink would.  I especially value that it is so low cal as compared to my normal iced tea mixes.  The single serve is very convenient but I wish it also came in a bulk pack for the mass consumption I intend to do if our Pacific Northwest weather ever gets warm!"

This flavor stix doesn't have a bad aftertaste and it is bursting with strawberry flavor.  My husband took a drink from my bottle and he said he would like a bottle all his own because he really likes the taste also. I will be looking for this flavor again when my box is all gone.
1992,B007I7Z3Z0,A2YCUCEYXT9VHX,"Donnica Carter ""AKA DCSquared""",3,This was a little too sweet. The mango and pineapple kind of overtake the tea. But if you like really sweet tea then you will love this. Obviously it is very convenient. You just pour the packet into a bottle of water and shake. I would even venture to say you could use half a pack and it be just as good. This may need a little diluting. But still recommend.
1993,B007I7Z3Z0,A3EP6YVAYS9YM3,Book Worm,4,"The predominant flavor of this drink mix is mango with a hint of pineapple.  I really do like it.  It's also very convenient.  Each packet/stick is just enough for a 16 ounce water bottle.  After a vigorous shake, the powder totally dissolves.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it is less than the Crystal Light drink mixes.  Really good.  I do recommend."
1994,B007I7Z3Z0,A1MKPMJPD22YY,"S. Cline ""Retired Fed""",4,Pretty impressive for Lipton for their fruit infusion which is amazing! I found this to work better when you insert these packages in the 16.9 ounce bottles and THEN refrigerate them as they dissolve easier this way. In addition; I had even used the remainder in my small CamelBak® while I went on a 60 mile cycling tour on March 31st on my Trek® (Racing / Touring Cycle) to keep hydrated. I adore Mangoes and Pineapples; but come across mixing this with tea - that I have never heard of(I own a Mango tree and grow Pineapples)!<br /><br />It's great for anyone who is a FRUIT FUSION lover or a smoothie lover or those who dare to venture into something different!
1995,B007I7Z3Z0,A28X7NZ02016FO,eCognition,3,"This is a pretty-tasty tea mix and I like the slim profile of the packet which allows you to pretty much stash it anywhere you want until you need it. The ""open here"" slot makes it easy to rip the end of the pouch open without having to use your teeth, but the hole that results is a little small for the tea to pass through easily, which means you got to work it through for a couple seconds, causing a little powdery mist to form outside of your drink container if you're not careful.<br /><br />At first, I thought it was the container I used to mix the tea in-or maybe that I was using tap water-that was causing this slight bitter beginning-taste to it. But it isn't either of those things. The powder just has a slight taste to it that may or may not turn you off to the drink.<br /><br />Each packet is 10 calories and 2 carbs. It says 5 calories, but if you take a second glance, that's for 8 oz of water; the full packet makes 16oz. If the directions are for 16oz of water with a small bottle of water pictured (like the kirkland signature ones from costco), then can we get a nutritional count for the whole 16oz, please? I didn't dock anything off the rating for this, given that it's printed right on the packet, but c'mon...<br /><br />Overall, a nice little product to give your bottled water some extra tasty kick. Not a fan of that first split-second it hits the palate, but if you're busy, you might not even notice."
1996,B007I7Z3Z0,A3RMS65F4GT4ML,"Billie Rae Bates ""BRBTV.com, BillieRae.com""",4,"Overall, I have been enjoying this drink. It's fruity and pleasant, with a honey taste that comes through pretty strongly. I like that it's decaf, so I can drink it any time of day. I like that it contains sucralose instead of aspartame.<br /><br />I have been using one packet in a large, 16-ounce glass, since each packet is technically two 8-ounce servings. The pink powder smells strawberry-ey at first (sorry -- I'm much better at book reviews than these food reviews!), and the color once mixed with water is a nice deep pink. The granules are big and take some stirring to dissolve, which the package does indicate.<br /><br />Amid the fruity and honey taste (and smell of honey) it's hard to detect any tea flavor. I picked up a little blueberry as I continued drinking it the first time. Could I tell that it contains green tea rather than black tea or any other kind of tea? Not at all.<br /><br />I like that it's low-calorie (though not technically sugar-free, since, as the ingredient list states, the honey granules contain sugar). But I've been avoiding sugar lately, so I'll take it!"
1997,B007I7Z3Z0,A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS,"P. Falcioni ""Ducatisti""",4,"I love iced tea, and usually enjoy it home-made and unsweetened. Unfortunately, there are some activities that keep me from dragging along a large jar of home-made tea, so I have to settle for the fake stuff.<br /><br />I've tried the Crystal Light versions, and have universally hated the aftertaste, although I like plenty of their other flavors. I had also tried a Lipton version of their ice tea and lemonade a few years back, and wasn't that impressed. This one looked intriguing, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I always mix these with 26 oz rather than the 16 oz they usually call for, and at this strength the tea flavor is rather diluted, however the sweetness and mango/pineapple tang are near perfect. Very refreshing and enjoyable.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this mix takes quite awhile to dissolve in water, and it will settle to the bottom if you don't cap the bottle and shake aggressively for half a minute or so before drinking."
1998,B007I7Z3Z0,A3SDBL8SJC2ME3,"Typical Consumer ""AGN""",3,An instant iced tea mix with good taste. Dissolves quickly. For my personal taste its a little sweet but MOST people who drink sweet tea drink tea as sweet or sweeter than this. Its a great quick substitute for brewed iced tea when none is available or for on-the-go use.
1999,B007I7Z3Z0,A31AVXMESQRQAC,Just Loves Books,4,"I really liked the taste of this. I mixed it with 16.9 water bottles, cold from the refrigerator. I found it took quite a bit of shaking to mix the powder in, and never did get it completely dissolved as there were still tiny bits that settled to the bottom. I think if you drink some from the bottle before adding the drink mix, it would allow more room for mixing in the bottle.<br />The strawberry taste was excellent, not too sweet and no strange aftertaste. I really like that it is low calorie without artificial sweetner. It makes drinking my daily intake of water easier.<br />The packets are small enough to tuck in a pocket for use on the go. The package has a notch to make opening easier. I will definitely buy these. I would have given five starsnif it was easier to dissolve."

2001,B007I7Z3Z0,A2BN9DIBP9A0XG,"D. Vance ""NinjaKnittingGramma""",4,"This is the second flavor of Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix that I have tried. This mango/pineapple is delicious! It mixes easily and leaves no residue.<br /><br />My two gripes: Why on earth package a drink mix designed for water bottles as "" mix 1/2 package with an 8 oz bottle""? Who buys those? The most common size of water bottles in my section of mid-america is 16 oz. Just stupidity.<br /><br />And, the misleading title of ""tea with honey"". If you check the ingredients, there is way more than honey sweetening this beverage. How about sucralose  and maltodextrin?<br /><br />So, basically, it's just another sugared beverage. But it is pretty tasty!"
2002,B007I7Z3Z0,A27ULPK1RGCNU6,Picky CO Mom,3,Have to give it 3 stars as I thought it wasn't bad but my husband hated the after taste. It does have a little bit of an after taste but I didn't think it was too bad. My husband disagreed. So if you want something different than plain water or soda give this a try.
2003,B007I7Z3Z0,A3GMVCTJTHYG1F,Mom22boys,4,"I love the To Go sticks that you simply mix in a bottle of water!  I've had many different brands and flavors over the years.  The Lipton To Go Iced Green Tea and Honey with Blackberry Pomegranate wasn't too bad.  Both of my kids (ages 6 and 7) wanted to try it too.  The 6 year old gave it a thumbs down but the 7 year old gave a thumbs up.<br /><br />The powder did not dissolve too well.  I shook and shook and shook but there was still some parts that were not dissolving (both in chilled and unchilled water.)  I also don't like that the instructions are to mix in an 16.9 oz container of water, but the serving suggestion and caloric information is all based on 8 oz (Why can't we keep things simple?)  Still at 10 calories for a 16.9 oz bottle of water, that isn't bad.  No fat, only 1 gm - per serving - of sugars.  The big plus for me is the 10mg of caffeine that it has per serving!  I can skip my afternoon coffee but still get that extra little lift to get me through.<br /><br />It also says that it is naturally sweetened with honey.  Which, yea, it has honey granuels in it, but it also has sucralose.<br /><br />Overall it is pretty good as a water enhancement powder.  I would buy in the future."
2004,B007I7Z3Z0,A1UWSU5ETQRQKX,Mr. Fred,4,"This is quite a good product; the beverage comes in easy to mix and use individual packets, and boasts a low 10 calories per serving. But the low calorie count doesn't sacrifice flavor; the brew is smooth and refreshing, if not quite crisp, and will make a fine drink for hot summer days. The drink mixes up to an attractively clear and deep purple color.<br /><br />The predominant flavor is blackberry, which seems to overpower the others. Honey could be distinguished only as a sweetener, not for characteristic honey taste. Pomegranate could not be easily detected. And, surprisingly, there was little green tea flavor, a result which I wouldn't have expected in a Lipton product, most of which seem to have carefully engineered tastes.<br /><br />There is one unusual use for this drink that I'll bet the designers didn't anticipate: It makes a very good mixer for neutral-flavored alcohol add-ins (adults only, please!).<br /><br />I give this four stars for convenience, good flavor, low calories, and versatility. One star comes off for the lack of tea flavor in what is sold as a tea drink."
2005,B007I7Z3Z0,A21SL94J53BDS9,LGM,4,"These To-Go drink mixes are great. They are so convenient to buy, store, and use. They are economical too. This specific flavor though is not my favorite. I like the Tea & Honey Blackberry Pomegranate flavor much better.<br /><br />In terms of sweetness, though, it is just right. They tell you to use 16.9 ounces of water, but I always add more water (about 22 oz) to these To-Go type powdered drink packets, and I find that much better.<br /><br />There are 5 calories per packet. It has a mix of sugar, honey, and sucralose (same thing as splenda) which keeps the calorie count down.<br /><br />While I wouldn't buy this in the future, if you like strawberry, then you might like this flavor."
2006,B007I7Z3Z0,A3JISS7CQJF8JL,"Joy V. Smith ""Pagadan""",3,"Lipton's Tea & Honey Iced Green Tea, the Blackberry Pomegranate flavor this time around, has a perky berry taste I like, unfortunately with the slight after taste of a diet drink (possibly the sucralose sweetener). The ease of putting it in a 16.9 fl oz. water bottle is a plus, and after several shakes, the packet dissolves nicely.  I appreciate being able to make some bottles ahead of time."
2007,B007I7Z3Z0,AO2AQRPPSTABB,Jeffrey J.Park,4,"This is a great tasting, low calorie iced green tea mix  from Lipton.  It is not too bitter, although the use of sucralose, which is extremely sweet, makes it a bit on the sweet side for my taste.  My wife loves the stuff - then again she does not mind artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Speaking of sucralose, I was surprised because it appeared that Lipton had actually come up with something that was not bad for you.  However, closer examination of the ingredients revealed use of an artificial sweetener (sucralose), which is one way to make the iced tea sweet and low calorie.  Although this is probably the least offensive of the artificial sweeteners, I generally avoid them like the plague.  Besides, the only reason why I was excited about this tea mix was because it appeared natural - tea, honey, strawberries - how could I go wrong?<br /><br />Each package contains approximately 4 grams of the iced tea mixture - because it is so sweet, you could probably get away with using less than the recommended serving size (1/2 package or 2 g) and it would still taste pretty good.  I might go with 1/4 package. Whatever you do, don't dump the whole package in a glass.  As far as the flavors go, strawberry overwhelms everything else - this tastes like the fruit drinks my children love.<br /><br />For those of you that don't care about ingesting artificial sweeteners you will probably enjoy this iced tea mix - it does taste pretty good.  I generally liked the stuff, although I will dilute the mixture next time around."
2008,B007I7Z3Z0,AI0PLL5DQAHRG,"Ty Arthur ""xFiruath""",4,"Looking for a way to spice up your drinking water and getting tired of adding lemons or limes?  Lipton's Tea & Honey mix adds a flavorful new option already divided into individual serving packets, which makes it easy to add to a water bottle on the go or a full glass of water at home.<br /><br />This particular flavor is quite different from the standard powdered mixed drinks, having a strong honey taste with a light strawberry twist.  There isn't much sugar in it either, at only 2 grams per packet, so it's an option to consider for diabetics or people watching their sugar intake.<br /><br />Plenty of other reviewers have noted there is a small amount of sucralose (Splenda) in here, which is something to consider if you don't care for artificial sweeteners. As the husband of someone with Type 1 diabetes I've gotten quite used to it and find it to be a very enjoyable flavor, so it didn't personally bother me at all.<br /><br />If you don't have time to brew up iced tea at home and want a quick flavor boost for water, this is a great option, and is an excellent way to make bottled water more exciting on picnics or car trips."

I mixed it in a 20 ounce bottle of cold water - the directions say use a 16.9 ounce bottle - and it still tasted just a bit too sweet to be called perfect.  The powdered mix is not as fine as Crystal Lite but a little thicker and coarse, so you will spend a little bit more time shaking the bottle in order to mix it properly.<br /><br />There are 10 calories per packet, even though the front of the box says 5 calories in big letters because each packet is two servings.  That's about the same as Crystal Light.  Overall, this one is pretty good and I think I will try out a few of their other flavors to add some variety."
2010,B007I7Z3Z0,A24J6PQ0FN55A6,WestGrl,4,"Normally, I hate any zero calorie drink. Artificial sweeteners have a bad aftertaste to me. So I didn't have high hopes for this. Well, I was surprised. This tea is partially sweetened with natural honey so I guess this helps to eliminate some of the aftertaste. This particular flavor is very fruity & refreshing. I poured the packet into a 16 oz. bottle of water and it was great. The packets come in convenient travel size packets that would be easy to stash in a purse or pocket. This is a really nice alternative for someone that wants something fruity & not loaded with sugar & calories. Can't wait to try the other flavors!"

The powder mix instantly dissolved in cold water.<br /><br />The strawberry flavor is refreshing but reminded me of Crystal Lite or Koolaid.  My son found it too sweet; however, it was just right for me.<br /><br />It seemed more like a fruity drink rather than a tea beverage."

I could get two bottle/cups out of one packet. 1/2 pouch is plenty of flavor for my tastes.I will definitely purchase this in the future."
2013,B007I7Z3Z0,A1I477ADGMLVJM,"D. Matlack ""Guidedog""",4,I did enjoy this just add water & mix fruit tea. Because of the tea granules it does take some mixing which is not a problem. I was surprised that the drink could have a strawberry flavor that was sweet but not too fake tasting also I was wondering about the strange aftertaste that was reminiscent of a diet drink.<br /><br />The drink touts itself on being sweetened with HONEY and other natural juices yet maintains its paltry 5 calories without the aid of aspartame - so it is healthy right? Well that super sweetness is in thanks to SUCRALOSE an artificial sweetener that just happens to be 600 times as sweet as table sugar and 3 times sweeter than aspartame.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />So the drink is an official diet drink if NOT 100% natural.
2014,B007I7Z3Z0,A1U3MD058WEWYU,mango113,3,"This is a powder drink mix that you can add to your water bottle. (Each packet is meant to be added to 16.9 fl oz of water.) I think it tastes okay, but it is more like juice than tea. I don't really taste the green tea part. It reminds me of the Celestial Seasonings herbal teas. I tried the drink both cold and hot, and it tastes fine either way. The powder doesn't dissolve as readily in cold water but stirring helped. The only thing I don't like is that even though it claims to be only 5 calories without using aspartame, I noticed that there is sucralose in the ingredients list. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener used in sweeteners such as Splenda, and I've never liked the taste of it."
2015,B007I7Z3Z0,A688RIZ2POWSQ,"L. Jenkins ""Many hobbies in Texas""",4,"It seems to me that this ""TEA"" product mirrors some of my crystal light products. I think Lipton is trying to get a bigger step in this flavored water market.  For me, seeing a name like Lipton on the box would push me into buying this product until I taste it and then I think of crystal light. Although tea is the third item on the ingredient list, for the life I me I can't taste ANY tea.  The first two are honey granules (sugar) and citric acid for tartness.  The third is green tea powder.<br /><br />Another thing that is really odd is that the packet, of which there are ten in the box...half of the packet is a serving. But, when I think about this, isn't that what crystal light is also?<br /><br />Getting down to what I thought of this product...Doesn't have enough tea in it for me to drink it as caffeine. Even when I put the whole packet in 20 ounces of water, it was still too, too, sweet and strong."
2016,B007I7Z3Z0,A3EAP2VG0BVYWX,nekojita,4,"One thing is certain, they don't skimp on the blackberry and pomegranate flavors in this drink!  If anything, they overpower the taste of the tea - if you're looking for something along the lines of a tea drink lightly flavored with fruit, this one might not be for you.  But it tastes good and is refreshing, especially for the warmer months (a slight false sugar aftertaste aside).  This mix was a bit different than the usual powered drink additives I've tried out there and there's the nice green tea bonus as well (which might explain why the fruit flavors overwhelm the tea as it's not as strong as black tea).<br /><br />Other than the faint sucralose aftertaste, my only other complaint would be that a 'serving' is half a packet - perhaps I'm not familiar enough with these drink sticks to know that you're only supposed to use half (which seems ridiculous) to consider it a full serving.  Seems a way to cheat to get that five calories claim."
2017,B007I7Z3Z0,A35X2JJI49OBZP,"C. Bayne ""katluvr_1""",4,"This doesn't taste like green tea to me, but it tastes a lot like strawberry kool aid.  That's OK because I LIKE strawberry kool aid, and I'm not a big fan of sweet tea.<br /><br />Most of this is sugar or sweetener of some kind - ""honey granules"" (sugar, honey - they added sugar to honey?  Really?), maltodextrin (corn sugar), and sucralose (Splenda).  There's green tea powder, hibiscus extract, strawberry juice solids, and acai juice solids are the flavor.  The flavors work well together, but again, it's pretty sweet.  I tried it full strength with 12 ounces of water, and it was too much.  I poured half a packet into a 20 oz bottle of water, and it was almost the right strength.  The cool thing about that is that a box of this will last a little longer for me."

This product comes in a box of 10 small pouches full of drink mix. The directions say to pour the mix in a 16.9 oz bottle of water and shake vigorously or pour into a glass of water and stir. It warns that the tea takes some time to dissolve, and it did- about a minute of stirring before it was fully dissolved. It was easy to mix with a bottle you can shake, but it does eventually dissolve. The tea itself is fairly sweet, but still nice and tart enough for me. I preferred to water it down even more than the box suggested and put one pouch into a 20oz. bottle which made it more palatable for me. However, if you prefer your drinks more on the sweet side, I would follow the directions as stated.  There is about 20 mg of caffeine per pouch as well and 10 calories per packet. Overall, pretty tasty little drink mix! Definitely a convenient way to zing up your water on the go!"

A perfect blend of honey, tea leaves and real fruit solids make it a healthy alternative to sodas.  Each packet makes two 8 oz servings, which have 5 calories, 10 mg of caffeine, and 2 g of sugar.  Although I usually drink a whole 16 oz, I still don't think it's too bad.  My daughter mixed a packet by agitating it in a 16.9 fl oz water bottle, and experienced no problems dissolving it.

Not the case.<br />First of all, drink mix packets are everywhere these days. Most of them are designed for a 16 oz bottle and plainly say so. For some reason, Lipton has decided to print directions that say to add 1/2 packet to 8 oz of water. Why? How many people actually buy 8 oz bottles? And, if they felt their product was aimed at those who would seek out 8 oz bottles, why not make the packet with just enough for that? Just odd.<br /><br />'Tea and Honey"" is proudly proclaimed several places on the package. Classic combination. Clearly stating ' NO asperatame!"". ""Sweetened with honey, Real tea leaves, real fruit flavors"". But there was a funny, artificial taste. Reading the ingredient list reveals: sucralose and maltodextrin.

Most of the mini packs of powder feel to me like I'm adding chemicals to my water glass, which seems to counter the healthy idea I'm going for in drinking water. These packs are pleasant tasting, although they don't really taste at all like tea - think of them more as a Crystal Light type equivalent. I also couldn't really taste the honey - I would have described them more as a generic ""berry"" flavor, but not cloyingly sweet."
2022,B007I7Z3Z0,A39KOJG83K8F1U,temply123,4,I've been drinking this at work and it is a good alternative to soda. I tend to like my drinks on the weak side so I water this down a little more than the directions say because it is pretty strong. I can't imagine drinking this in the middle of winter but it is perfect to throw in a gym bag in case you want to put some flavor in your water while working out.<br />I wasn't even aware that the product is low calorie (5 per serving) I was just wanting something different so the low calories a big bonus.

The tea mixes up in your water like coolaide, and comes in individual packets so you can take it along with you. However, the packets do not tear by hand, but you must use a knife or scissors to get them open. That is the only thing that needs to be improved."

Bratcher Jr.,4,Got my package today so I opened it up then put one packet in a bottle of drinking water then put that in the fridge so it would get cold as thats the way I like to drink tea. Did the same to another packet & water bottle. A few hours later I decided to taste one of the cold bottles. A nice strength when added to a 16.9 oz bottle without being overpowering. I did shake the bottle before opening it of course. Good & tasty. Not too strong on the sugar & a nice mix of flavors. Be aware this will turn the water red in color which is not a problem. I might buy some of this when my box of 10 packets runs out. I'd say try this. You just might like it as I do!!

It might be nice to try this if you love all the flavorings listed, but I will stick to the more basic flavors."

Taste-wise it didn't taste as much like brewed tea and instead tasted like the typical sweet tea that comes out of a soda tap machine.<br /><br />It tasted good w/ a mango taste if not tea like.

Definitely reminds you of KoolAid.  Its extremely sweet, but does have a tart pom feel to it.  But I have to admit, I like and and it gets me to drink more fluids.  I think you could ideally mix with 24 oz and not 16 oz as recommended on the package since its pretty sweet.  Has a lot of coloring but seems like natural color."

These are the small packages that you can take on the go and mix in water bottles; the 16-ounce bottles of water is what is recommended. I'm on a plan that was set up by my Nutritionist and in this plan, sugar is a big no-no. This drink is perfect because it has an artificial sweetner in, that's close to splenda, and there's no aftertaste. For a drink with artificial sweetner, the taste is great! This is a real good sweet tea substitute and I'm glad that I decided to try it."

With separate powder packages intended for single servings, this is a product that's perfect for use at the office or on travel.  My only complaint is that the amount of power seems excessive for a sincle serving, making it difficult to dissolve the entire packet even in a pint-sized glass and leaving unwanted residue in the glass."

I diluted it in water (dilutes fairly easily) and then added ice cubes for an icy cold drink.<br /><br />Each box comes with ten individually wrapped packets. The corner of each packet is pre-cut, so it is easier to open and you don't have to hunt for hard to find perforations. Each packet is good for a 16oz drink. If you find it too rich, you can always increase the amount of water or use one packet to make drinks for multiple people.<br /><br />One packet has 10 calories, all sugars. There is no other nutritional value on the label.<br /><br />If you are cautious about artificial sweeteners, this one has sucralose.<br /><br />The green tea is decaf, and indeed I did not feel a caffeine kick.<br /><br />The outside box is nice and colorful, but the drink definitely doesn't taste as good as it looks in the picture.<br /><br />The bottom of the outside box and the individual packets show an expiration date, but it is not written in a straightforward fashion from a consumer's perspective.<br /><br />The overall rating is closer to 3.5 stars out of five, but closer to a 4 than a 3.

2044,B007I7Z3Z0,A2KMY4RVMJ1EP6,faeriemyst,1,"I was quite excited to try Lipton's new Tea & Honey To Go packets. While I was a bit skeptical of the five calories proposed for each 8-ounce serving, seeing as how honey is a fairly high caloric sweetener, I figured I'd give it a go anyway. So after receiving the tea, I mixed it up per the instructions and took a sip. Yowzas! The tea was super sweet with a bit of strawberry flavor and no tea that I could taste. I ended up watering the tea down enough that one packet, which is usually two servings, ends up as four or five 8-oz. servings. The berry flavor became very diluted while there was still that taste of icky sweetness. Overall the berry flavors and tea are weak, even undiluted, and I noticed no honey flavor what-so-ever, so took a look-see at the ingredients where I spotted sucralose (an artificial sweetener) thrown right in the middle of things. Now that is where the sweetness is and don't take kindly to that addition, as I avoid artificial sweeteners whenever possible. Seeing as how Lipton is sneakily claiming this is sweetened with honey (And look! NO aspartame!), with no mention that in actuality the sweeteners are honey granules, which are made from both honey and sugar, and sucralose except by viewing the ingredients list, makes me angry because I've been swindled. Yeah, this is natural all right. I'm definitely not going to trust Lipton's marketing from now on and urge them to think about switching to a natural sweetener such as stevia. So if you like your food natural, best to skip this, but if you're not so picky and don't mind artificial sweeteners in your food, then give it a go if you're interested. I'll not be trying any other flavors of this product."
2045,B007I7Z3Z0,A2MSQNPTNAAGL1,P. Cannon,1,"Tea&Honey hmmm sounds like it might be all natural but it's NOT. Before I even opened this box, the smell of it turned me off. I poured this into 20 ounces of water which was even more then the 16 oz it called for and then tasted it, GACK, this is clearly not honey!  One swallow and I tasted this in my throat and mouth for an hour and the after taste is horrible. Even the glass I poured it out of, I couldn't get the smell out of even after washing it. This is so putridly sweet I could barely swallow it. I assumed this was as the front of the box said in BIG letters Tea&Honey, well it's not just sweetened with honey. The misleading product labeling did not clearly state that this is full of Sucralose (Nutrasweet by another name) and Maltodextrin two products I would NEVER put in my body knowingly. Both make me sick and give me migraines. Question is WHY? Why would you put artificial garbage, chemical sweetener in green tea that was already sweetened with sugar and honey?<br /><br />Lipton, this product is very misleading. You should Clearly state ""Artificial Sweetener"" and or ""Diet"" on the FRONT of the package so people who care what they put in their bodies won't buy this by mistake. Can't you just keep it all natural?"
2046,B007I7Z3Z0,A3G5MOHY1U635N,"APF ""SPB-RU""",2,"The product's name lead me to believe it would be naturally flavored with flavors I like.  Unfortunately, the flavor of the artificial sweetener is very pronounced and it is a flavor I strongly dislike.  I do not use artificial sweeteners and avoid artificially sweetened beverages because I do not like the flavor, not for health reasons.<br /><br />I used one packet per 24 oz bottle of water and I am sure that if I were to mix it per instructions it would be way too sweet.  I was not able to taste honey or pomegranate.  Blackberry is somewhat pronounced, although not as a natural but as an artificial blackberry flavor.<br /><br />I also had a problem with packaging.  When I tore the corner of a packet at notch, the resulting hole was too small for the contents to pour out.  I had to jiggle the packet and push the contents out.  That created a cloud of fine dust which I inhaled - not pleasant.  I struggled with the second packet as well.  It is possible that it is just the batch I received that did not have the tear notch punched properly.<br /><br />The description says ""Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors."" I am surprised this kind of marketing is allowed or tolerated.  It is just as much (probably more if you consider contribution to the total sweetness) sweetened with artificial sweeteners as it is with honey.  As for the green tea or pomegranate flavor...  Who can tell that this tastes anything like either one of those things?  It seems like a manufacturer can show to a cousin of a random employee a picture of tea leaves and pomegranates and let them listen to bees buzzing and then claim that the product was made with tea leaves, honey, and real pomegranate flavor.<br /><br />I would not buy this product the way it currently is."

I love nearly all drinks that contain blackberry or pomegranate so I thought this would be a home run.  What a disappointment!  I cannot even describe the taste aside from to say it is very artificial.  The clean crisp natural taste that was expected never occurred throughout the two packages that I drank.  The smell was even artificial.  In fact when I first smelled it, I nearly dumped it down the drain.  It also took some time and a lot of shaking for all of the particles to dissolve into the water.

By initial appearances, this looks like it could be very good.  Sweetened by honey - good, natural - good, but then take a look at the actual ingredients.  Not much natural about this.  Sure honey is one of the ingredients, but so is sucralose.  I know plenty of people are fine with this or use it as a substitute for sugar for dietary reasons, but I can't stand the stuff.  Of course tastes vary between any two people and you may enjoy this, but be aware that it does contain artificial sweeteners if that is not what you are looking for."

2059,B007I7Z3Z0,A3JHC8O59WDHFZ,Silea,2,"Blackberry and pomegranate, green tea, and honey sounds like a lovely combination. Unfortunately, none of those flavors come through in this product.<br /><br />Despite a honey and sugar combination being the first ingredient, the artificial sweetener dominates the flavor of this drink. A berry-fruity-acidic flavor is the next most prominent, but if i'd tried this drink blind i don't think i ever would have guessed it was supposed to be blackberry and pomegranate. I couldn't catch the faintest whiff of green tea flavor or honey, no matter how hard i tried.<br /><br />When i made my first glass of this, i probably mixed it too strong. A single packet (two servings) is supposed to go in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water, but i just mixed mine into a glass. It took a fair bit of stirring to get it to dissolve.<br /><br />My first sip was of an overwhelmingly cloying mixture. It was like being punched in the mouth with fake sugar.<br /><br />I poured half the glass out, and refilled with water. Same experience, but more of a slap than a punch. I continued pouring some out and refilling with water, hoping that at some point it would taste less like fake sugar and more like any of the components advertized on the front. Unfortunately, as i diluted it more and more, the acidic generic fruit flavor faded out, while the artificial sweetener stayed strong. Never did green tea or honey visit my tongue.<br /><br />I suppose for a person totally habituated to artificial sweeteners, this product will taste entirely different. However, if you assume based on the fact that 'honey' is featured prominently on the front of the box that this product is naturally sweetened, you're in for a nasty surprise."

I know the green tea flavor is more mild, so if you are looking for an iced tea tasting beverage this isn't it.<br /><br />The serving size is half a packet to 8 ounces of water, so really what you are looking at is one packet to a normal sized water bottle (16.9 ounces) which puts it at 10 calories vs. 5.<br /><br />The product boasts ""No aspartame"" but it does contain sucralose, so it still has that artificial sweetner taste.  That doesn't bother me at all, I'm used to it.<br /><br />I found it dissolved quickly in the water and I wasn't dealing with undiluted chunks.<br /><br />This won't become my new beverage of choice or anything, but it's tasty and easy."

2064,B007I7Z3Z0,A26BU3ZU0R5IPF,*~ Sunshine ~*,4,"I've had a number of instant drink packet mixes in the past from various vendors.  This, Lipton Iced Green Tea mix, is similar in the fact that it comes in a box of 10 packets, each ready to mix into a 16.9 oz. bottle of water or a like-sized glass of water.  I used it in a glass, stirring with a spoon, and it dissolved quickly for me.  I found it to be quite strong even with added ice, and ended up adding more cold water to suit my taste. I thought the flavor was good.  I could taste the honey, blackberry, and pomegranate flavors but found it was a bit overly sweet, and this comes from a confessed sugar junkie. Still, I enjoyed it after adding the water and would choose it again.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, a serving is only 8 ounces, though you mix each packet in a 16~oz. bottle of water.  I can't imagine what the purpose of making this distinction is, other than to qualify the ""5 calories per serving"" claim on the front of the box.  Would 10 calories a serving be a deal breaker for most people?<br /><br />There are no other noted nutrition values besides 1 gram of sugar and 10 mg of caffeine per serving.  It states that each 8 ounce serving contains 60 milligrams of flavonoids, which is more than cranberry juice and almost twice that in orange juice.  From an internet reference, ""Flavonoids have antioxidant activity. Flavonoids are becoming very popular because they have many health promoting effects. Tea flavonoids have many health benefits. Tea flavonoids reduce the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein, lowers the blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.""<br /><br />To summarize, I enjoyed this drink and would purchase it again.  It is convenient, tasty, and provides a few health benefits."
2065,B007I7Z3Z0,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""",4,"I'm an iced tea lover, and I enjoy most varieties, including green tea.  I tend to prefer plain/lemon teas to other fruit types, however, but I still decided to give this product a try, as I liked the idea that the tea is sweetened only with honey (i.e., no artificial sweeteners).  According to the packaging, each 8 oz. serving has 5 calories and 10 m.g. of caffeine.<br /><br />I really love the convenience of the little individual packets!  They are easy to tear open, and you could toss one in your bag/purse or bring them to work (which is what I did).  The dry crystals dissolve nicely in water.  For my own tastes, the tea was a bit too fruity--although it didn't taste like fruit punch (which is what I don't like about some fruit-flavored teas), you can definitely taste both the berry and pomegranate flavors.  However, I could also discern a tea taste as well as a touch of honey.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good product, and I would definitely recommended it to those who enjoy fruit teas."
2066,B007I7Z3Z0,A29C0Z6BY8HB9H,Mom of three,3,"I tried this Strawberry Acai Decaf Green Tea Mix along with my two daughters ages 10 & 12. My 10 year old didn't care for it, on the other hand, my 12 year old liked it and said it tastes like liquid strawberry jello. A serving size is 1/2 a packet and 8 oz of water, only 5 calories, and 1 gram of sugar. It is sweetened with honey and also sucralose. It is perfect for the 16.9 oz water bottles which would be double the serving if you are counting calories but still only 10 calories and 2 g of sugar. It does say it's Decaf Iced Green Tea, strawberry acai flavored. I don't taste any iced tea at all, if you like strawberry flavored drinks then you'd probably like it, because strawberry is definitely the only flavor you taste. It's great drink for kids being so low calorie and so low in sugar as compared to the usual juices for kids and the packets are also very easy to open. I only gave it 3 stars because for me it just wasn't the flavor I was looking for, I wanted to be able to taste the iced tea. I would try a different flavor or maybe just the plain iced tea."
2067,B007I7Z3Z0,ARSQ2F9U315WG,Biblioholic Beth,4,"I was curious to try this, as the ""Honey"" part caught my eye. I have tried the previous edition that had the aspartame, and it had a strange aftertaste that I wasn't fond of. I like to have little packets like this to keep in my purse or in the car though, and the flavor sounded pretty good.<br /><br />As soon as it arrived, I read the box. I wanted to see what the ingredient list was. And so I must say, if you're looking for something with no artificial sweetener at all - BEWARE. This does not have aspartame, but it DOES have sucralose (otherwise known as SPLENDA). I was a bit disappointed when I read that, as I was hoping it was just honey as the sweetener.<br /><br />However, I went ahead and made some - I even measured out the 16.9oz so that my initial taste-test could be as accurate as possible. I smelled the packet when I first opened and could definitely smell the mango. The pineapple was less pronounced. Then I the water in a glass container with a lid (I wanted to see how well it dissolved). One good shake and I could still see some bits (probably the honey) floating around. Two more really good shakes and other than a small bit in the bottom, it was all dissolved. I opened the lid of the container and took another smell - again, very strong mango, with a bit of pineapple. It smelled really good. As for the taste - it lives up to the smell. I really like it. I don't get any aftertaste from the sucralose, and the fruit flavors are not too strong. It's not overly sweet, though that is individual taste and can be easily fixed by adding a bit more water.<br /><br />Overall, despite my disappointment with the addition of sucralose (which is why I gave it 4 stars vs. 5), I would happily buy this. It tastes delicious, can be adjusted for taste, dissolves easily, and is convenient to carry around."
2068,B007I7Z3Z0,A70NFM6KHU24F,Trevor Burnham,1,"There's a stark disconnect between the front of the product's packaging (which promises ""Iced Green Tea"" with honey and natural fruit flavors) and the actual product. Lipton could conceivably have marketed convenient packets of gunpowder green tea, with its characteristic bitterness subtly curbed by tiny amounts of honey and fruit oils. Such a product might have been a hit with the health-obsessed, ingredient-conscious crowd that already enjoys unsweetened tea. Instead, they decided to go for a more mainstream audience: people who crave sweet-as-soda beverages, but want to feel good about what they're drinking.<br /><br />The result is a product that's almost indistinguishable from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5DHE"">Sugar Free Kool-Aid</a>, but will likely be brought to market at a much higher price point based on its supposed healthfulness. The Lipton Stix packaging brags that (unlike Kool-Aid) it's got ""no aspartame""--because it uses the artificial sweetener sucralose (aka Splenda) instead. Yes, green tea powder is the third ingredient (after honey granules and citric acid)--but to give you an idea of how much tea there is in this ""tea mix,"" a chart on the side brags about Lipton Stix containing 60mg of flavonoids per serving, comparing favorably to cranberry juice and orange juice. This is an extremely selective comparison. Most pertinently, a cup of tea typically contains anywhere from 200mg to 1000mg of flavonoids, depending on the variety, density, and brewing process.<br /><br />Now, it's one thing to emphasize a product's naturalness (""natural flavors,"" ""made with real ingredients,"" ""tea & honey,"" ""real fruit flavors"") without mentioning the artificial sweetener anywhere other than the ingredient list. But there's one claim that I believe to be overtly deceptive: ""sweetened with honey."" Let's examine that. Honey is listed in the ingredients as ""Honey granules (sugar, honey),"" which means that there's actually at least as much sugar as honey in the product. A half-packet serving has ~1g of sugars, so even under the generous assumption that there's as much honey as pure sugar, there's only about half a gram of honey per serving. Is it conceivable that you could detect half a gram of honey in 8oz of water? Certainly not if you add enough sucralose to make that 8oz of water taste as sweet as fruit juice (~25g of sugars).<br /><br />So to summarize: At best, honey accounts for 1/50th of the sweetness in Lipton Stix that the sucralose provides. Shame on you, Lipton."
2069,B007I7Z3Z0,AFK893ELKDPY,Irene Watson,1,"If you are thinking this ice tea is sweetened with honey only don't buy it.  Yes, it has honey as a sweetener but it's ""honey granules (sugar, honey.)"" As well, other sweeteners are sucralose, maltodextrin, and isomalt.  These ingredients are not disclosed in the description but they are on the package.  I have no idea how it tastes because I didn't taste it; my preference is not to ingest chemical sweeteners or sugar.  In addition, one 8-ounce serving has 10 mg caffeine; one packet is two servings.<br /><br />I'm only giving this product 1-star because of  lack of disclosure.  When I read the description in the Vine Newsletter I was under the impression this product was sweetened with honey only. This is not the case.  If you don't mind sugar or chemical sweeteners then I suggest you read other reviews about flavor."

I mix one packet in an empty one quart power drink bottle and I find this palletable to my tastes.I enjoy the flavor so I mix several quart bottles and partially freeze them and have plenty of water bottles to drink while I work outdoors in this heat and keep me hydrated all day long. They also had a coupon for $3.00 off the order.  I ended up paying $12.00 that makes me 120 quarts of this drink mix.  To me, that is a bargain.  I hope others got this incredible bargain."
2082,B007I7Z3Z0,A1GPSZB8V7FMG5,ezjay,4,"I bought the ""Black Currant Raspberry Black Tea"" flavor and like it. The primary flavor is the fruit, but you can also taste the black tea under it. I saw some people complaining about not enough tea flavor in the green tea based flavors, but I think the problem is just that green tea naturally has a light flavor. Since this one uses a black tea, it is not a problem.<br />I also tried the ""Blackberry Pomegranate Green Tea."" I don't mind the flavor, but it is much more like Koolaid, with a very strong sweet pomegranate flavor and little tea flavor."

There is a ton of these little stix. The taste is refreshing, my new favorite summer drink.<br /><br />Only complaints that do not give this a 5 star (not the taste, but the packaging:<br />1) There are literally 12 packs of 10 stix, lots of cardboard and wasted packaging. You'd think they'd be a bit more efficient and have them all in once box.<br />2) The tear to open each stix sometimes rips all the way down the packaging, getting powder everywhere. The first time I opened these, powder got everywhere. Crystal Light packets open across the top horizontally. These have the slit vertically, it's not good. Beware.<br /><br />Even with the horrible packaging, I love these and will be buying more!"
2084,B007I7Z3Z0,A3MYNS21528COD,Terri Merritts,5,"I got a sample of the Mango/Pineapple flavored tea and really liked it a lot so I now buy this product regularly in the grocery store.  I am on the go a lot and like to keep a cooler of ice with bottled water in it in the back seat. Plain old water is just boring after a while. I do carry a bottle of home brewed iced tea with me but still I like to use the little to-go stix of all sorts from different companies and this is a very nice addition to my options.  I really liked the Mango one so I tried the blackberry/pomegranate one and liked it less. My favorites are the mango, peach, and strawberry ones.<br /><br />As a diabetic, I like to watch the calories and carbs and this is a refreshing way to flavor water without a lot of sugar. It is quite convenient to carry along to flavor water and tastes fruity. If you are avoiding sugary drinks , this is a good choice. Kids also love this and it is nice if you are having a fast food lunch with kids to carry along a cooler of ice with bottles of water and add their choice of Lipton To Go Stix to the water instead of buying tooth-rotting sugary sodas at restaurants. There is only one gram of carbs and it has 10% of your Vitamin A requirements (at least the Mango Pineapple one does). It is made with real green tea leaves instead of just artificial flavoring and green tea has health benefits.<br /><br />I recommend this product."
2085,B007I7Z3Z0,A58G6VXS9P15Q,Mia,5,"I have purchased every one of the tea flavors they make. This is my personal favorite. The aroma is pleasing, the taste is refreshing and the overall experience is wonderful.<br />The honey is what makes it my first choice. I don't need to add Splenda or other additives. It is all natural which I consume frequently."
2086,B007I7Z3Z0,AK9Q7JLFPP3BJ,Darcy Bee,4,"While attempting to avoid aspartame flavored drinks I found the Lipton Tea with Honey in the Blackberry Pomegrante flavor.  It tastes good, although it can be a bit too sweet.  Instead of adding one package to 8 ounces of water I add it to 16 which makes it better.  The first ingredient is Honey Granules which is a combination of honey and sugar, and several ingredients later is Sucralose.  While I prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners all together I do not mind Sucralose (generic for Splenda) as much as I dislike aspartame.<br /><br />It also has 60 mg of flavanoids per serving.  All in all I would recommend this product."
2087,B007I7Z3Z0,A1HYH206E18XVC,Bass Cadet,3,"As someone who drinks green tea every day at work, I thought this would be a good selection. It seemed to have everything I like: green tea, mango, honey. It does, but unfortunately, it also includes some non-desirables. For me, Sucralose is an unproven benefit and I generally avoid it if possible.<br /><br />It is too bad Lipton adds it to this tea. It over-sweetens the tea and adds the undesirable ingredient. I am used to the slightly bitter green tea taste and think covering it up takes away from the overall appeal. I would prefer a little more honey instead, but even then, I think unsweetened green tea is sellable as is. The mango flavor is about right, while I did not detect much, if any, pineapple flavor.<br /><br />Half a sachet is sufficient flavoring for a pint of water. Adding the entire sachet is excessive for my taste."

Easy to mix and toss in a couple of ice cubes.<br /><br />If not for the following two complaints, I could give this product 5-stars:<br /><br />1) Half a pouch is deemed a serving. Okay, 5 calories vs. 10 calories isn't a big deal, but seriously who is only going to use half of one of these tiny tubes? Most people don't even understand how little 8oz is. Starbucks serves 8oz short drinks, but they don't list it on the menu and people would probably laugh when they saw the size...just as an example.<br /><br />2) Advertising that there is NO aspartame is hugely misleading because it 'suggests' there is no artificial sweetener since honey is prominently displayed and listed. Yes, there is no aspartame, but there's sucralose, which is also an artificial sweetener. And WHY even have an artificial sweetener when honey is the very first ingredient listed?<br /><br />I don't get why it's difficult to reconcile such issues as the ones I've noted here.<br /><br />Like I said, the tea is tasty and refreshing, but those who make the product, package the product and market the product need to get real."

The Unilever product comes in a small box, packed in ten handy flutes.  It is, the manufacturer states, made from real tea leaves and contains 60 mg tea flavenoids per eight fluid ounce servings.  It is also sweetened with honey, and real fruit flavors.  It is, as well, easy to prepare.  You can add a packet to one bottle (16.9 fl. oz. of water), or half a packet to an eight ounce glass of water: just stir and enjoy.  The tea does take a little bit longer to dissolve than some other mixing powders, so you do have to shake, or stir well.  It's obviously a handy thing to keep on hand for the office, the gym, the backpack, or anywhere you are on the go.  I've found it a handy pick-me-up when I am hot, thirsty, and tired.<br /><br />I found the taste quite sweet and delicious.  What can I say, I just love mango Margaritas, figure somebody snuck that recipe out of paradise.  The pineapple taste here does add a bit of tartness, too.  However, in the list of ingredients I find sucralose and corn maltodextrin as sweeteners: these ingredients concern me.  (Of course, I've no idea what might be in the mango margarita mix that bars use, so..)  I'm not a dietitian, just do my best to eat healthy stuff; this drink might, still, be more healthy than diet soda, I just don't know."

Although the strawberry flavoring is natural, it does taste similar to artificial flavored drinks such as Kool-Ade. It also does have a moderate aftertaste. It's not as bad as some other sugar free soft drinks, but it is noticeable. I also find the drink tastes better if you add more than the recommended amount of water. If you like drinking sugar free soft drinks such as Diet Snapple, etc., you'll probably like ""Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai"".

My second and third sips were much more to my liking.  I still got the mango and pineapple sweetness right away but the taste after that was more mellow with the hints of honey and green tea.

I quite liked it. I drink a lot of these types of beverages so have tasted quite a few of them. I did find it hard to dissolve in cold water. If you have ice in it then it is even harder to dissolve so I recommend water first, add packet, dissolve, then add ice. I found that I only needed half the packet to get the flavor and taste I liked. This is unlike some other drinks where the whole packet in a bottle or container of water is required. It is very sweet and fairly strong. I did not find any bad or bitter taste as can sometimes happen with decaffienated beverages. If it dissolved better it would have had a higher rating.

Using a little less than one packet, or a larger water bottle, provided a better taste for me. If one likes very sweet, use the whole stick.

I probably wouldn't buy it, but I don't usually buy instant iced tea mixes anyway.<br />The fruit flavor is OK.

2105,B007I7Z3Z0,A108XP24UESKSV,"E. Kay ""eclectic6""",5,"Lipton To Go Green Tea & Honey Mango Pineapple was a nice new discovery. I usually buy Crystal Light products, but I may very well buy Lipton products from now on. My friend described this drink as ""green tea with a bit of mango,"" but my description would be a bit different. While I do love green tea, it can be slightly bitter at times. This had none of the bitterness. Actually, the green tea flavor was very subtle. To me, it tasted more like a tropical fruit punch, with mango as the dominant flavor. With only 5 calories, you really can't go wrong. All in all, I was really impressed with this product, and I will most likely be buying it again in the future."
2106,B007I7Z3Z0,AX0ZTNX6KVJ40,J. Jones,5,"I am a fan of Lipton Iced Green Tea so when I say the new Lipton Tea and Honey Decaf Iced Green Tea on Vine I had to give it a try.  The flavor is great and it fits the bill for anyone does not want artificial sweetener in their drink.  There is a trade off.  While the original Iced Green Tea had no calories, The Tea and Honey has 5 calories per serving.  Another plus is that while there is soy lecithin in the The Iced Green Tea there is none in Tea and Honey.  While some people say that soy in lecithin form does not bother people who are sensitive  to soy not having to worry about soy is nice.  I got the Strawberry Acai flavor and found it mild and enjoyable.  I did notice that it took longer for the Tea and Honey mix to dissolve but that was a minor problem.  I will be switching to the Tea and Honey now that it is available."
2107,B007I7Z3Z0,A1LGB9RZX3SR0P,"maxmasa31 ""maxmasa31""",5,"First off, buyers be warned that it's a low-calorie drink, which means it has that ""diet taste.""  If you've had any diet drinks, like Diet Coke, you'll know what I'm talking about.  I know some people hate it, so if you're one of those, I doubt this will change your mind.  Also, I know some people like unsweetened iced tea, so take note that this is (artificially) sweetened.<br /><br />That said, my wife and I really like it!  The one we tried was the mango-pineapple flavor, which was really refreshing.  The box comes with ten packets, with each packet for one 16-oz. bottle of water.  As one reviewer pointed out, one bottle of water wasn't enough, and it was a little too sweet for our taste, too, but when we used more water (about an extra 8 oz.) and put in some ice cubes it was perfect!  The mango taste is stronger than the pineapple, but it has a great tropical iced-tea taste to it.<br /><br />I'm not a big soda drinker, so with spring and summer around the corner, I'm glad to have come across this on Vine.  It is a great, refreshing drink for a hot day and I like that my wife and I can each have a decent serving size from the single packet and just think--now we're getting half the calories of an already low-cal drink!  Of course, your mileage may vary, but if you drink diet sodas or juices, give this a try!"
2108,B007I7Z3Z0,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""",5,"Blackberry and Pomegranate flavor was already a hit with me. My opinion is exactly the same with Mango Pineapple. Good strong Lipton flavors, very sweet for the sweet tea lovers, but I like mine less so, thus, here's what I do.<br /><br />I must watch my calories, sodium, sugar, and fat due to health issues. Thus tea is a preferred drink over sodas. I want to live, and live a good lifestyle. This product helps. The flavor was fruity, as good as I expected after trying another flavor earlier. I've tried lots of flavored teas from other makers and usually have gone back to regular plain old Lipton. This is different, it's good.<br /><br />IT'S HEALTHY, BUT IT CAN BE MADE EVEN BETTER (IF NEEDED.)<br />FOR 8 OZ (that's half a packet, as the packet makes over 16 oz.) you get ZERO Fat & Sodium. Sugar's only 1g (per 8 oz.), calories only 5. 10mg caffeine if that's an issue for you, not for me.<br />After realizing the drink was a bit sweeter, like southern sweetened tea, and I'm used to less sweet, I tried mixing the drink with an equal amount of club soda. By doing this you cut the nutrituion facts in half (per 8 oz serving). WOW. Even better. Now the bold Lipton Blackberry Pomegranate and or mango Pineapple flavor is still there, but less sweet. I enjoy the drink's fizz from the soda. Remember equal club soda/water mixed with the same amount of Lipton mixed as directed has a serving size (8oz) calorie cut to 2 ½, sugar only 1/2g. The drink came out as clear as sun tea.<br /><br />Kids will love this sweetness. Kids need drinks with low calorie count. That's becoming major for child health.<br /><br />Convenience is a plus, an easily opened individual tube of powder, travel friendly, a freshly mixed drink at work, or make it one bottle at a time at home. No more having several types of bagged tea on the shelf to mix one with another, and then a remaining half-pitcher of tea going funky in the refrigerator. This has a shelf life of well over a year. It is tons better than instant teas I've tried, easier storage than bottled brew, and has the refreshing taste that the world has come to expect from Lipton. My sample convinced me to begin converting from the mess of tea bags.<br />I'm sold, 2 flavor attempts and both very satisfying to me. Now, which flavor should I try next?<br /><br />Dare I mention this can be carried in a shirt pocket or purse to a restaurant and instead of ordering those overpriced drinks, ask for the free iced water, then pour in your Lipton, stir, and ""Bob's your Uncle""."
2109,B007I7Z3Z0,A3AQO91DYWF8R0,Seth Caddell,5,Lipton Tea and Honey is delicious. I enjoyed it very much. It is very sweet and refreshing. There are only 5 calories but it is so rich in flavor. The fruit flavors of mango and pineapple are strong and delightful. I also like that is has real sugar and not aspartame. I would say it is almost addictive; I enjoyed it so much. I would recommend it to all. The packets are snipped for easy opening. You just add one packet to a 16 oz bottle of water and stir. It takes a minute to dissolve and then you can drink.
2110,B007I7Z3Z0,A5H8NA5CJ0FK4,"K. ""daisy4given""",5,"Every single week I buy a new box of water flavoring for my family. We have a hard time finding ones that don't have artificial flavoring and colorings, and usually when we DO find one they taste awful. But this new Lipton product has made my whole family so happy! It tastes AMAZING without any nasty after taste, it's low in calories, but I feel great knowing that it's got all-natural sweeteners and colors in it. I will never buy a different kind of water flavoring again!"
2111,B007I7Z3Z0,A3CA3RWZYJDWXE,BJ Fraser,5,"I usually drink regular iced tea--unsweetened and usually decaf if I can get it--but I decided to give it a try.  Really if you're not a tea drinker this tastes a lot more like Kool-Aid or Crystal Light than tea.  The sweetness from the honey and blackberry disguises most of the tea flavor from it.<br /><br />I should probably note I haven't really used the product how it says to.  Instead of putting one packet in a bottle of water, I dumped seven packets into about 2-3 quarts of water.  Maybe that makes the taste stronger than in a single bottle.  Myself I don't really have a need for a single 16.9-oz bottle of tea, but other people might.<br /><br />Anyway, I liked it, though probably not enough to buy it instead of my regular tea mix, which I'm sure is much cheaper.<br /><br />That is all."
2112,B007I7Z3Z0,AJX23GRISOTOD,Louis Coniglio,5,"I drink a ton of water every day, but I like to mix it up.  I've tried a few of the Mio drinks, but they can be quite expensive.  Green tea is an excellent antioxidant, so I like to drink it as much as possible.  The strawberry-acai flavor is really nice, bright and sweet, but because of the use of honey/mix of sweeeteners, it tastes quite different than a product using white sugar.  It's 10 calories per full packet (serving size, as listed on the package, is half a packet or 5 calories), but a whole packet will make at least 16 oz. of flavored water- more if you're like me, since I tend to prefer it watered down a bit more.  Overall, this is a great way to add variety to one's daily water intake.  I'll be adding it to my pantry on a regular basis.<br /><br />Update 4/4/12: It was brought to my attention that this contains artificial sweeteners.  If you do not want that in your diet, please avoid this product.  If you're like me, and don't mind artificial sweeteners and use them sparingly, this drink will be in your wheel house."
2113,B007I7Z3Z0,A1P8DIBAXF6H37,Kurt Conner,4,"When I try a powdered drink mix, I am interested in three factors: First, I want the stuff to taste good.  Second, I want it to dissolve well.  Third, I'd rather drink something without a lot of calories.  This drink satisfied all three conditions for me, so I would be interested in buying more in the future.<br /><br />The drink tastes good.  It's a little sweet for one packet mixed into a drinking glass, but there are enough fruit flavors to make the sweetness a bit complex and worth tasting.  I didn't taste the pineapple at all, but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced, not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste.  It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix.<br /><br />The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds.  There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth.<br /><br />Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks.  There are lower calorie sweeteners out there, but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time.<br /><br />This is not a must-drink experience, but it's very good by powdered drink mix standards, and I recommend it."

This particular Lipton product is great if you want to get the benefits of green tea but you're not that fond of the flavor of green tea. What you get is mostly the tropical mango pineapple flavor and barely a hint of green tea. Although the tea is primarily sweetened by sucralose, the hint of honey makes this taste less artificial and more natural."

I recommend a 24 oz glass and lots of ice.  Pour in the mix and stir.  Does take some extra mixing, but ice tea it is.  I was somewhat disappointed in the flavor however.  There was a tea undertone, but the basic taste was honey, which also overwhelmed the mango & pineapple, which was negligible.  I drank it all over 1/2 hour.  Iced tea more or less it is, but the honey flavor is king.  Of course, it is not ""sticky"" like real honey.<br /><br />I don't know.  I prefer others to this.  Maybe if the flavors were more balanced i would enjoy it.  I still prefer to make my own..."

I do like the ease of adding the packets to 16.9 fl. oz. of bottled water (cold from the fridge) and drinking the flavored bottle water later. Btw, be sure to shake it well so it all dissolves."

Rather than lovely 50 degree weather and watching the tulips and magnolias SLOWLY begin to open up their buds, we're having SPRING ON STEROIDS, instead! So, break out the grill, the flip flops and the Iced Tea!!!<br /><br />My family and I go through copious amounts of tea. Being British, everything in life goes better with tea, either hot or iced. This Lipton product was a nice addition to our life-style and I hope they come out with different flavours to carry with you on hot days. We gave this a trial on a long hike in the dunes off of Lake Michigan. Had our supply of water bottles and the wee packets to add to them. Of 6 adults and 2 teens, this tea received a 4-5 star rating, over all. We enjoyed that it was actually sweetened with honey, rather than nasty fake sweetener. And we really enjoyed that you could taste that tart tea taste that we enjoy so much; it wasn't overshadowed by the fruit flavour.<br /><br />Normally, I don't enjoy products added to water as they turn out too sweet or just too ""too""...meaning TOO fruity, sweet, or whatever. This product nailed the perfect blend of turning water into something pleasant to drink, rather than needing plain water to WASH the taste of an added product off of your taste buds.<br /><br />Good Job, Lipton!!! Now, make a Honey and Mint version and I'll be a Happy Camper! :)"

Not overly sweet and  with a hint of honey. Just the right blend<br /><br />The packet that the power is contained, very easy to open,  unlike some of the other brands. The powder mixes well, unlike other brands.<br /><br />I recently had purchased the SodaStream soda maker, and use a liquid flavoring, I prepaired the carbonation in the bottle and poured in the Lipton packet ..... Oh boy!  It started to fizz and bubble and the color was a bright red like a strawberry! What a mess .... however, when it settled down the carbonation disapated and<br />I found that the ice tea had a rich light taste. Tip:  if your try this tea  carbonated  a light carbonation is advised ...Also, if you want a drink like a light water, just use less from the packet.  Refreshing and half the cost of flavored waters.<br /><br />The only down fall for this powdered tea is the color!  Scarlet Red, it stains if you spittle.. (bg).  Other than that, I will looking forward to our grocery store<br />has the new Lipton Ice Tea.<br />Diffently recommend this product."

Just pour it in a bottle of water and volia! Instant green tea with a yummy taste perfect for a hot summer day. I sampled the Strawberry Acai flavor and thought it was delicious. I am tempted to try the other flavors like peach apricot or blackberry pomegranate. What I like best is that it doesn't contain aspartame like most of the flavor packets on the market today. With only 5 calories per serving, what's not to like? It is sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves, and real fruit flavors."
2123,B007I7Z3Z0,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,a,4,"In an ongoing effort to avoid diet soda during the day, I have turned more and more to liquid and powdered water enhancers.  They are often hit or miss in terms of taste, but I'm pleased to say that Lipton's ""Tea & Honey"" Strawberry Acai is a pretty solid product.  That said, be aware that this sweet drink tastes far more like a strawberry punch than it does tea.<br /><br />Obviously, for marketing purposes, Lipton is playing up the ""all-natural"" use of honey.  A quick glance at the ingredients, however, shows that while there is granulated honey on the list, there's also plain old sugar and, perhaps to add sweetness yet keep the calories down, the artificial sweetener Sucralose.  As a result, this is a very sweet-tasting drink.  It does, however, have a pleasant strawberry taste, and I'm primarily concerned about the taste.  One might argue, however, why a person should avoid diet soda if they are going to use a powdered mix that contains artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Another marketing ploy I noticed was that the ""5 calories per serving"" is actually two per packet, which cannot be resealed.  Essentially, you are supposed to pour the entire packet into a standard bottle of water and then, I guess, drink half (for a single serving).  I don't know anyone that would actually do this, so Lipton would be better off labeling this as ""10 calories per serving,"" which is far more accurate.  Lastly, the box warns that these drinks need to be shaken at length to dissolve the tea.  That's very true.  It took several minutes of solid shaking to make all those little tea granules disappear.  Don't shake and drink quickly unless you want grit in your mouth!<br /><br />These things aside, I did enjoy this sample and plan to use the entire box -- probably faster than anyone would recommend.  While not addictively delicious, it's more refreshing than bottled water and probably better for me than diet soda.  Give it a try!"
2124,B007I7Z3Z0,A1YGIUSI2JTTSC,Dan Bobinski,5,"In a word: Yummy.  The blend of flavors is quite unique and refreshing.  Even my wife thinks it's good, and she is not a fan of drinks containing artificial sweeteners.  Each packet is die-cut making it very easy to open, too (no spilling).<br /><br />Bottom line, this a full-flavored drink mix that makes a 16-oz bottle of water taste great.<br /><br />Mar 31, 2012 UPDATE:  Since reviewing the Mango Pineapple, we picked up the Blackberry Pomegranate and the Strawberry Acai Decaf varieties, as well.

I admit that I tried this after having a packet in my car for while but then it is made to travel, right?<br /><br />The taste is OK but nothing exciting. If I thought about it, I could taste the tea and honey but mostly I tasted the sweet Kool-Aid type taste.<br /><br />I was excited to find this as I cannot tolerate artificial sweetner. The sweetner (besides honey) is made from sugar but is low cal. I'm not sure how that is going to work for me.<br /><br />Overall, not bad but not exciting."

It's smooth and not too sweet as others say; and the packets are small enough that I can easily carry a bunch with me and then buy (or bring with me) bottled cold water to mix it with. If you're on the run, I think mixing the powder into the water using a small swizzle stick should work.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this product.

You take a bottle of cold water, tear open the packet and pour it into the bottle.  Replace the cap and shake.  This tea does take a little longer to mix so you have to give it quite a few shakes but that isn't a problem.  The taste is lovely.  It takes like tea and fruit.  Honey is used as the sweetener and there is just a little bit added so it isn't too sweet.  It's just perfect.  I guzzled that first drink down and now I'm working on a second...

The Unilever product, the manufacturer states, is made from real tea leaves and contains 80 mg tea flavenoids per eight fluid ounce servings.  It is also sweetened with real fruit flavors, and is, as well, easy to prepare; just stir and enjoy.  The tea does take a little bit longer to dissolve than some other mixing powders, so you do have to shake, or stir well.  I find the caffeine helps as a pick-me-up when I get in hot and tired in the afternoon.<br /><br />I found the taste quite sweet and delicious.  What can I say, I just love the berries of summer, all of them, blueberries, and blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, stop me before I start raving...  I just, at a local farm stand, run by a local farmer with a good reputation, bought strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries all at once, with only me to eat them.  And I did, don't worry about that.  Anyway, the pomegranate taste here does add a bit of tartness, and pomegranate is also considered quite healthy.  However, in the  list of ingredients I find Aspartame (Sweetener), Corn Syrup Solids, Modified Corn Starch,  Maltodextrin, and  Acesulfame Potassium as sweeteners: these ingredients concern me.

Just pour it in a glass or better yet, a bottle and take it anywhere with you.  Because it is decaffeinated, you can enjoy it anytime without the worry of caffeine jitters.  It is also low-calorie(sweetened with sucralose,) so this might be your guilt-free beverage."

I like the fact that you put your ice and water in a glass and pour the packet of Stawberry iced tea in and stir.  It isn't overly sweet.  It tasted good and was a great alternative to soda.  I like it better than the soda stream we have and is a lot less work to make.  If you like decaf iced tea and want a different taste other than black or green tea then this is a buy!  THIS IS AN UPDATE AS OF 6/18/12.  I purchased a case of Strawberry and a case of Blackberry/Pomegrante.  I love this drink and so easy to mix!  I have also put 2 of each in my purse so when we eat out I can drink this instead of soda pop.  I make sure I have a plastic spoon in my purse.  Hope those of you who would like to try it like it as much as I do.  My husband thinks it is a really smart idea, he likes it also.  We are saving money when we eat out!"

I keep these on hand at work to spruce up a plain bottle of water when I want some flavor.  These stix are really convenient to travel with too.  I can get a bottle of water anywhere and add the tea for a kick."

This mango pineapple has a great taste, not too sweet. It has a slightly tropical taste but is not overpowering, even when mixed with a smaller bottle of water than what the directions specify. I took a couple of sips to allow shaking room, then add the powder. The packet is easy to open without spills, yet sturdy enough not to tear open in a handbag or pocket. It does take quite a bit of shaking to completely dissolve the powder, but nothing too difficult.<br />I will buy more of these.

A bottle of water, a slip of a package and away I go.<br /><br />The best part of this tea not only the connivance of travel, the cost but the taste!  Each and every one of the different flavors  I say ...Oh!  This is my favorite ..Actually All of the flavors are my favorite.<br /><br />The only draw back and it is minor, you have to really shake the powder to get it to smooth out.  Like I said a minor mention.<br /><br />When I first tested this tea, I looked but did not find them in any green grocery, now, well every where you look ...you find them.. I purchased  for my hubby, who keeps them with him while at work and myself to keep extra in the car... both of us enjoy the taste of the Lipton To Go Green tea with all the great flavors."
2154,B007I7Z3Z0,A2SDRCBPIAXVDW,J. Plummer,1,"By initial appearances, this looks like it could be very good.  Sweetened by honey - good, natural - good, but then take a look at the actual ingredients.  Not much natural about this.  Sure honey is one of the ingredients, but so is sucralose.  I know plenty of people are fine with this or use it as a substitute for sugar for dietary reasons, but I can't stand the stuff.  The mix of different tastes (tea, pomegranate, sucralose) is very unpleasant to me.  Of course tastes vary between any two people and you may enjoy this, but be aware that it does contain artificial sweeteners if that is not what you are looking for.  I have also tried the Mango version and although it also contains sucralose, it is a bit more tolerable."
2155,B007I7Z3Z0,A1YCV76MUFESR1,Anne-Marie Gilliland,4,"This makes me think Kool-aid for grownups. It is  that deep red color and pretty sweet tasting. I was pretty impressed since I am not a huge powdered drink fan. And, I normally am all about plain water. But we had a week or so without juice in the house and this gave me a sort of juice-fix. I mostly drank it in a glass, so not all the little powder bits mixed in as well as they would have in a bottle of water.<br /><br />The way the little packets rip open is really nice, they are already sort of halfway torn for you, and at an angle, so the powder falls pretty neatly into the drink.<br /><br />I'd recommend these to someone who enjoyed falvoring their water."

Everything from soda, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and flavored water, so we always enjoy giving new beverages a try.  Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix is a blend of tea, honey and strawberry acai that comes in a 10-Count box with each powdered package producing a 16 ounce drink.  Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Easy to make, just add water, stir/shake and you're done.<br /><br />+ Convenient for travel.<br /><br />+ Good way to add flavor to water.<br /><br />+ 5 calories per 8 ounce serving.  One packet makes a 16 ounce serving.<br /><br />+ No aspartame.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Contains sucralose.<br /><br />- Doesn't really taste like tea.  Tasted more like strawberry Kool-Aid or Jell-O to me.<br /><br />- May be a bit too sweet for some.<br /><br />Powdered ""On-The-Go"" drink mixes always seem to be hit or miss in our house.  Most of the time they taste terribly artificial or too tart/sweet for our tastes.  Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix was no exception.  It tasted very little like any flavored tea I've ever tried.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for a sweet and refreshing drink.  However, I think many people will have difficulty equating the flavor of this drink mix with tea."
2157,B007I7Z3Z0,A2K3J2X8KDY47N,"Jewelry Lover ""me""",2,"Decided to try this on the Vine.<br />It tastes like weak strawberry flavored koolaid.  It would even be better if mixed with soda water to give it some kind of soft drink appeal.  I tried serving it to the rest of my family including kids and not a single glass was more than half consumed.  Save your money and try another kind/flavor.  I keep 'sticks' of lemonade flavored Crystal Light in my purse.  This is so disappointing in comparison.<br /><br />You wouldn't expect green tea to taste strong like black tea, but the tea in this drink is virtually flavorless.<br /><br />Bottom line:  wouldn't buy it again."
2158,B007I7Z3Z0,AO9UNKQG83BUP,Book Fan,2,"They keep saying ""naturally sweetened with honey"", but it is like sweetener overkill with sucralose.  Way too sweet, overwhelms any berry flavor that is there, and no green tea flavor is discernable.  Diluting it makes the oversweetened taste become obvious as the berry flavor recedes in the distance, with still too much sweetener.  (Though if you like things extra sweet, you may enjoy this).<br /><br />Too bad.  Try the True Lemon family of unsweetened dehydrated citrus juice packets instead."
2159,B007I7Z3Z0,AO9UNKQG83BUP,Book Fan,2,"The box proclaims ""Sweetened with Honey"", and honey granules are listed as the first ingredient, so I thought, finally, something that is just lightly sweetened.  Uh, no, once I tasted it I double checked the fine print ingredients and saw that there is Sucralose in it.  While honey granules might be the largest ingredient by volume, by taste, it is overwhelmed by the artificial sweetener.  When a maker is so deceptive in the presentation of the product, it makes me wonder what else is misleading in it.<br /><br />I tried diluting it, in order to reduce the sweetness.  Well, the berry flavor receded into the background, but it was still too sweet.  Too bad.....<br /><br />It tastes like punch, and the convenience factor is great.  I love the way there are so many of these little single serve water flavors available now, but the artificially sweetened ones are way too sweet, as is this one.  For now I stick to True Lemon unsweetened, and the other unsweetened flavor products from that company.<br /><br />If you like drinks to taste sweet, with a sweetness that lingers in your mouth for many minutes after taking just a sip, you'll probably like this product."

These sticks are meant for 16 ounce water bottles, but I empty a stick into a one (1) liter empty bottle which I fill with water from my Mavea water pitcher.  It still tastes heavy on the pineapple; in fact, I don't notice any mango or tea flavors at all. There is a ""too sweet"" aftertaste, also."

I saw what was printed on the box, ""blackberry pomegranate flavor with other natural flavor, no aspartame"".  Hey, that sounds good, but further box reading shows it contains sucralose, here is one comment I found about sucralose:  According to the book Sweet Deception, sucralose is made when sugar is treated with trityl chloride, acetic anhydride, hydrogen chlorine, thionyl chloride, and methanol in the presence of dimethylformamide, 4-methylmorpholine, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetic acid, benzyltriethlyammonium chloride, and sodium methoxide, making it unlike anything found in nature. If you read the fine print on the Splenda web site, it states that ""although sucralose has a structure like sugar and a sugar-like taste, it is not natural.""  That kind of ruins this drink mix for me.  If a company (Lipton) wants to put Natural all over its packaging, then be natural all the way, not just a few ingredients."

Lipton's new ""To Go"" Stix are a great idea for travel and the flavor of the tea and fruits together are great. However, the sweetener used in this product is not so great.  I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, especially sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose IS an artificial sweetener. The majority of ingested sucralose is not broken down by the body and therefore it is non-caloric. Sucralose is approximately 600 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar),twice as sweet as saccharin, and 3 times as sweet as aspartame and BOY does it show.  I tried mixing this in different quantities of water and just did not enjoy it one bit.<br /><br />If the product was REALLY sweetened with honey, I would certainly enjoy it more. These packets are ACTAULLY 10 calories as opposed to the stated 5 as each stick is labelled for 8 oz instead of 16 oz.  There is also a problem in the dissolving properties of the sucralose.<br /><br />Purchase at your own risk..."

In order to make it taste like something, it tastes like a drink mix--too sweet and not very much like tea.  It's one of those products that people buy because of clever marketing -- green tea, decaf, low calorie, honey and Acai-- what could be better?  Actually none of it is good.  Lots of artificial sweeteners, no real honey to speak of, and an overly sweet taste.  Not healthy.  Not that great."

Initially in cold water, the mixture clumps up if not shaken well, but it eventually disolves completely.  The flavors complement each other well, the sweetness of blackberry tempered by the tartness of pomegranate.  Lipton's product is much more flavorful than some of the Crystal Light varieties I have tried.  I would definitely buy this product and try some of the other flavors."
2166,B007I7Z3Z0,A39WWMBA0299ZF,"C. Hamilton ""Latsyrc728""",5,"I was worried that the sugar and carb content in these drink packets might be high because of the honey used to sweeten them. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. There is 2gm sugar, 10 calories and 2gm of carbs per packet (it is listed as 1/2 packet per serving, but that is unrealistic). One packet makes about 16oz prepared. Each box comes with 10 packets. The packets are made with real tea leaves and each packet (2 servings) contains 120mg tea flavonoids.<br /><br />My first impression of this drink mix was something along the lines of ""ohh my..."" followed by a second quick drink. This stuff is WAY better than I thought it would be. I think I would actually prefer the taste of the Lipton Tea & Honey Blackberry Pomegranate to fresh brewed Blackberry pomegranate tea with honey. It is incredible! The honey sweetens it perfectly without giving it that over-sweet, bitter taste. The tea itself tastes more like a black tea than a green tea (which is a good thing in my book because black tea tastes better, but green tea seems to have more health benefits). It has a perfect harmonious balance between the blackberry, pomegranate and honey. They seem to compliment each other very well.<br /><br />This was my first time trying any of the Lipton Tea&Honey packets and I am tempted to run out (in pajamas and all) and snatch the rest of them off of the grocery shelf because I have a new favorite. Thanks Vine for bringing these into my life. I definitely recommend you try this....NOW.<br /><br />Note: all tastes buds are different and mine do tend to prefer super sweet drinks, so these may be too sweet for you if you like light sweetening. However, you can always add more water to your cup! I think you should try them and decide for yourself"
2167,B007I7Z3Z0,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""",5,"I must watch my calories, sodium, sugar, and fat due to health issues. Thus tea is a preferred drink over sodas. I want to live, and live a good lifestyle. This product helps. Expecting good taste since it is produced by Lipton, a favorite of mine and my wife's, this was hardly a gamble in trying. The flavor was excellent, strong, fruity, and actually better than expected. I've tried lots of flavored teas and usually have gone back to regular plain old Lipton.<br /><br />Fat & Sodium are 0. Sugar only 1g per 8 oz. and calories only 5. 10mg caffeine if that's an issue for you, not for me. After realizing the drink was a bit sweeter, like southern sweetened tea, and I'm used to less sweet, I tried mixing the drink with an equal amount of club soda. WOW. Even better. Now the Lipton Blackberry Pomegranate flavor was still there, less sweet, the drink had the fizz of soda, calories cut to 2 ½, and sugar only 1/2g. The drink came out as clear as sun tea.<br /><br />Kids will love this sweetness. Kids need drinks with low calorie count. That's becoming major for child health.<br /><br />Convenience is a plus, an easily opened individual tube of powder, travel friendly, a freshly mixed drink at work, or make it one bottle at a time at home. No more having several types of bagged tea on the shelf to mix one with another, and then a remaining half-pitcher of tea going funky in the refrigerator. This has a shelf life of well over a year. It is tons better than instant teas I've tried, easier storage than bottled brew, and has the refreshing taste that the world has come to expect from Lipton. My sample convinced me to begin converting from the mess of tea bags.<br /><br />Dare I mention this can be carried in a shirt pocket or purse to a restaurant and instead of ordering those overpriced drinks, ask for the free iced water, then pour in your Lipton, stir, and ""Bob's your Uncle""."
2168,B007I7Z3Z0,A3GK1O5S6188AJ,Amy Willingham,5,"Love the flavor of mango pineapple with a hint of green tea! Super refreshing to drink on a nice hot or warm day and I especially enjoyed it after a walk around the park. Quenched my thirst and didn't leave any disgusting after taste in my mouth that some other mix ins can leave. Super easy to mix into my drink: I just opened the packet, poured it into my cup, added cold water, and stirred. I had to stir for awhile to break everything up all the way otherwise I can see myself drinking little undissolved particles.<br /><br />What was so interesting about the flavor for me was how refreshing it was to drink and so flavorful. Right away you can taste the mango and pineapple, which are a perfect combination together, but there is also a hint of green tea behind those flavors. Thrown throughout the whole blend is a slight taste of honey that just compliments everything together. If your a fan of these flavors and are looking for a really refreshing drink, I have to say give Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea & Honey, Mango Pineapple a try for I am sure you will find it just as delightful and refreshing as I did.<br /><br />Please note that this is 5 calories per a serving, but keep in mind that 1 packet contains 2 servings so in fact it is 10 calories per a serving that I have been using. But I have also been using it in a really tall glass that holds more then 8oz of water (More like 13ishoz) hence both servings work just perfect for my taste level. Enjoy!"

Pineapple is in there, too, but I think the mango stands out. Either way, it tastes delicious.<br /><br />You just empty one of the long, narrow packets into 16.9-ounces of water -- either a bottle (and shake well) or a glass (and stir well). I used a glass of water, but will try it in a bottle of water on my next long, hot walk.<br /><br />Packets are scored, so they're easy to open -- a real plus -- and easy to pour into either a bottle or a glass.<br /><br />Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors.

2170,B007I7Z3Z0,A2VO8KOWIBPMPM,Don't have one,1,This new honey pineapple mango is awful.  The worst tasting powdered tea mix I have ever had.

The package says that half a packet is for 16 ounces of water and has two servings per packet.<br /><br />I used them in 32oz of water the first time however, it was sweet enough that I cut back to a little more than half a packet for 32oz and it still had a nice sweetness.<br /><br />It's a great product and I would purchase it without any reservation."

2174,B007I7Z3Z0,ATJN4KEHJBOC8,"KatyKatIL ""KatyKat""",4,"We tried this recently. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />First off, I am allergic to aspartame, so most of the great flavors of drink mixes out there are<br />already off my radar.  After living in a place with nasty ol' well water for a few years, I developed<br />a soda habit that I am trying to break. I've tried plain tea, don't care much for it, so looked for<br />a decent flavored tea that I didn't have to boil water for (partially disabled, and no stove, etc<br />where I am most of the time).<br /><br />Last time at the store, I saw these. The package is a little deceptive, so be aware!<br />That ""five calories"" is not even for one whole bottle of water - it is for HALF of a bottle of water<br />with ONE packet mixed in! I guess they didn't want to post double-digits of a whopping ten calories,<br />but that's what it is for one packet.<br /><br />The sweeteners are THREE KINDS - Honey, Sugar AND Sucralose. Why they needed three, I do not know.<br />It actually ends up being a little too sweet. I make it, them dilute it with more water than<br />it technically needs.<br /><br />Not sure why Lipton can't just make something ALL natural, or use stevia, which has no effect on<br />blood glucose. They seem to be hesitant to use it for some reason, but I don't know why. They have no<br />problems loading up the other drinks with chemical sweeteners, but avoid stevia!  Weird...<br /><br />I have had a lot of problems with my throat swelling up this week, but I have been sick. I am not sure<br />if it is related to the illness, or because I've been drinking this tea almost exclusively for the last<br />few days. Aspartame makes my mouth, tongue and throat swell up, which is why I read every label now.<br />Not sure if the sucralose is doing anything or not - I would tend to think not, because my lips are not<br />numb nor is my tongue swollen. Still, I'd avoid the sucralose if I could.<br /><br />The flavor is really sweet, but I like it. It is refreshing and tasty. Again, a little too sweet for my<br />personal tastes, so I ""water"" it down with lots of ice, and it makes it very good!<br />It's worth trying. This is the only flavor we've tried so far, but will definitely give the others a shot<br />as well. If it helps me give up soda, then that's even better! : )<br /><br />UPDATE JULY 9, 2012:<br /><br />Well, it has been incredibly hot here in the midwest, with a heat wave that broke all kinds of records.<br />Of course, I was drinking a lot of tea. These packets are 10 calories each (that ""5 calories"" on the box refers to HALF<br />of one packet!), and I had either one or two packets each day for the last month, perhaps.<br />We also tried the peach flavor now, and I don't care for it, but my husband and son like it better than this one.<br /><br />I had to come back and add to the review because of something kind of odd. Now, I am hypoglycemic, so maybe that is part of it,<br />but I have to mention it in case others have this problem. I got this tea originally to help me get away from my Pepsi habit.<br />The 24-oz bottles of Pepsi that I buy have 300 calories in the bottle. I make the tea kind of weak, so one packet actually makes closer to 32 ounces of liquid for me - I like the flavor better that way (just personal preference), so by comparison, I am getting just 10 calories for 32 oz, vs the 300 in the 24-oz Pepsi. Savings of about 97% of the calories, which should be a good thing!<br /><br />Here's the kicker - I have been GAINING WEIGHT since I changed over to the tea! Nothing else has changed. I didn't suddenly<br />take up eating endlessly, etc, and in fact, have eaten a little less during this heat wave. I put on almost five pounds in the last few weeks of changing over to this tea. Now, from a caloric standpoint, it doesn't seem possible. However, I am one of those people who does much better on high-protein, low-carb. If you have a similar type of metabolism/body, then be aware of these little packets!  I think it might be the honey in them creating a non-stop (because I sip tea all day long to keep cool) assault on my blood sugars. I've noticed that I feel hungry more often as well too. I normally don't get all that hungry - just have a few hungry days once in a while. With this tea, it almost gives you the munchies. I haven't indulged, so it isn't from extra food. It has to be the tea.<br /><br />Again, I have to say that I don't think that everyone will experience this effect, but wanted to bring it up.<br />I think the combo of the THREE sugars Lipton has chosen to use for reasons unknown are having a negative effect for me personally.<br />I still like the tea, but have now been cutting it down even more, to see if I can lessen the effects of the sweeteners.<br />I find it odd to think that I could cut out 590 calories a day (I usually drank two of those 24-oz pepsis! Yes, I was bad...) and GAIN weight. It has to be the way all those sugars are interacting with my system.<br /><br />So, if you are one of those folks who do really well on a low-carb diet, be aware that this tea could cause you to lose progress, or even cause you to gain weight. I have also warned my husband, who tends towards higher blood glucose, to only drink it with meals, never alone like I do.  Just an important heads-up on what could have been the best thing to happen to tea in a long, long time.<br /><br />Lipton - please try making something with stevia, which has no impact on blood glucose levels and has no calories. Why put sucralose into your items, when stevia is so much better?  I don't get it - it can't be that much cheaper to use! And I'd pay more for an item that used stevia... what a shame!"
2175,B007I7Z3Z0,A2JE8OS1NN9YDB,Space Queen,5,"My coworkers and I all love this instant tea.  It has 10 calories per packet (2 servings per packet at 5 calories each, but really, one packet goes with 16 oz of water).  It is a little too sweet when you first taste it, but after a couple of sips, we adapted and loved it!  I'll be getting more of this!"
2176,B007I7Z3Z0,A1MZEMD0EDETS6,C. Maynard,5,"I am mostly a water drinker, but occasionally I like to have a little flavor for my drink. The instant Lipton Tea mix provides that for just ten calories (five cal/8 oz.). It does have Sucralose in it, but it is pretty far down on the list of ingredients. I'm glad it has a little sugar, which leaves a much better after-taste than some other instant teas.<br /><br />This one (they have some other flavors) is Decaf Green Tea with Strawberry and Acai. You can put it in a bottled water, or at home I use one packet and fill-up a large glass. It comes with 10 packets, which works for me for a couple of weeks.<br /><br />The box boasts that it is sweetened with some honey and made from real tea leaves.<br /><br />For me, what made it a winner was that it didn't have a nasty after taste."
2177,B007I7Z3Z0,AT5GPE9RB7NQV,W. S. Perry,5,"This is a great convenience and great tasting product. I can find it in small quantities on the shelf at Walmart and other grocers but, not in higher quantities. The price point per box is less than 2.00 in most grocers but, do the math from the various merchants as I have found it frequently over 2.50 a box."
2178,B007I7Z3Z0,AVWWFK3FZDEL2,D. Mckinzie,4,"Update:after a week or so of drinking this, I decided to stop because I was having some odd health problems (upset stomach, etc) and a lot more sinus/allergy problems than normal.  I decided that it might be the Acai berries, that were causing the problem.  I looked on the internet and the berries are associated with some stomach problems.  I really did like it, especially diluted somewhat, but it's not worth the aggravation.  If you don't think allergies will be a problem, here's what I thought of the product:<br /><br />I decided to try this flavor additive for bottles of water because it is decaf and also, unlike most of those flavor-adds, it does not use Equal or some other sweetener.  I can't drink much caffeine at one time (more than a couple of sips can really mess me up) and I also can't use Equal or several other of the sweeteners.  This tea uses honey and the natural sweetness of the strawberries and the Acai berries to sweeten the green tea that is the basis of the beverage and it doesn't contain caffeine.  It mixed very easily with the water and had a nice taste.  I don't like my bottled water to have very much flavor, so I tried changing the ratio (it was one packet to each 16.9 bottle) to see how using half strength would work and I liked that even better.  I ended up just putting the bottle of water with the flavor in it inside my fridge door and I just get a glass of water from a plain bottle and then add however much of the flavor that I want.  My boss liked the flavor, too, when I gave him a glass full.  I wasn't sure how to tell the Acai berries from the green tea, but I could definitely taste the strawberry, so if you don't like strawberries, you probably need to skip this product.  But if you love them, maybe you've found this year's summer drink."
2179,B007I7Z3Z0,A8EBWQZIDKF78,"Janice Sims ""a reader & a writer""",5,"Be careful when opening the little packets because the powder is quite strong smelling.  I guess that comes with the powerful flavor this packs.  Also, as the granules take a while to dissolve I would suggest putting it in a container with a lid on it so you can vigorously shake the contents before pouring into an ice-filled glass (crushed ice is my favorite).  Then, you can enjoy this robust blend of strawberry, honey, and acai berries.  Lipton gets five stars from me."
2180,B007I7Z3Z0,A3CA3RWZYJDWXE,BJ Fraser,5,"I previously got the blackberry and pomegranate flavor off of a Vine newsletter.  I really enjoyed it so I decided to give this flavor a try as well.<br /><br />It's about the same.  Really if you're not a tea drinker this tastes a lot more like Kool-Aid or Crystal Light than tea. The sweetness from the honey and fruit disguises most of the tea flavor from it.<br /><br />Anyway, I liked it, though probably not enough to buy it instead of my regular tea mix, which I'm sure is much cheaper.<br /><br />That is all."
2181,B007I7Z3Z0,A30X750M8V1XXW,Scott,5,"I'm really liking these new Lipton packets. I've also tries their pineapple mango and its just as great. What I like about them is that they are great for traveling. When I go away, I usually buy a case of spring water and add one of these packets to the water. I'm not a big fan of just plain water especially on the beach so having this flavor makes the water delicious. They are very convenient to put in your pocket too. I always have one handy when going out to eat because I don't drink soda so i'll ask for a tall glass of ice water and add a pack of the Lipton to it. You get 10 packets in a box which is nice too. And lastly its decaf Green Tea with Honey so you get some antioxidants. I've tried many other brands and so many seem to have an after taste that tastes like chemicals. I'm happy to find that these didn't have that. They also have a peach flavor and a blueberry, haven't seen them in the stores yet but i'm sure by the summer they will hit the shelves.<br /><br />Its a great sugar free flavoring and enjoy them better than many others."
2182,B007I7Z3Z0,A3MKON3VM0W1TH,Alan Beggerow,5,"Like the other varieties available, these come in individual packets for use with bottled water which makes them really handy. This particular flavor of Blackberry Pomegranate is more intense than some of the others. Not a bad thing if you like both of the flavorings. Worth atry if you're a flavored sweet tea fan."
2183,B007I7Z3Z0,A3MKON3VM0W1TH,Alan Beggerow,5,"A powdered tea mix that's individually packed for use in bottled water, which makes it handy for on the go. The flavor is good if you like sweetened tea."
2184,B007I7Z3Z0,A2YPGQH2UGGTM2,J. Moore,5,"These one serving packets are becoming increasingly popular for people on the go and for those of us who like to take something other than water when heading to the gym, but dislike the chemical taste of many drink supplements. This product really fits the bill for something that's tasty ( without any wierd aftertaste) and somewhat healthy. Also for those who have wanted the benefits of green tea without the slight tartness of the tea itself, the strawberry acai taste is just exotic enough to make you forget you're drinking green tea. I liked it!"
2185,B007I7Z3Z0,A1ZENB34HH2EIM,"SAlaska ""S""",5,"These tea mixes are fantastic for work since they dissolve quickly and require no stirring IF you add them to your glass first.  Stirring or shaking is definitely ideal, but the beverage works without them.  Not too sweet and no bitterness that green tea mixes can sometimes have.  I didn't find that there was a pronounced tea flavor here, but enjoyed the light sweetness this mix added to a glass of cold water.  Oh, and I'd highly recommend adding ice AFTER mixing since ice seems to keep the powder from dissolving.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice and relatively low-calorie way to dress up water without a lot of artificial sweeteners."
2186,B007I7Z3Z0,A1SY4X1WWNOBX5,"theShepherdz ""theShepherdz""",5,"I wasn't prepared to enjoy this tea mix as much as I did. The Lipton to Go Stix Iced Green Tea with Honey (Mango Pineapple) was absolutely delicious. So much so, that I went out and bought two other flavors to try and mango pineapple is still my favorite. This is the perfect flavoring to jazz up a bottle of water and much better than some that tastes like koolaid. Two thumbs up."

Tse ""mitchelltse""",5,"I've drunk my share of powdered drinks, including stuff from Propel, Lipton, Crystal Light, even the Walmart brands, as well as the liquid concentrates, like the Mio.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this packet is that it's a bit bigger than the normal Lipton Iced Teas.  Well, it definitely made a difference in flavor.  Put this into a 20 ounce glass (it's designed for 16.9 ounce), and it was still full flavor.  Strangely enough, it's supposed to be Mango Pineapple, but the flavor seems more like Peach to me.<br /><br />Still, the flavor was very nice, again, slightly stronger flavor than the Lipton To Go packets I usually use (my favorite is the Lipton Iced Green Tea, Mandarin and Mango flavor <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HQAYLA"">Lipton Tea to Go Iced Green Tea Mix Packs, Mandarin & Mango, 10 ct</a>).<br /><br />Overall, very nice for me.  Definitely best with Ice."
2188,B007I7Z3Z0,A2FLJCJ3SW0TUY,"Brie ""Brie""",5,"Great taste. Each package is enough for two cups of water, more or less depending on how concentrated you want your drink to be. Therefore, there are enough powder for 20 cups, which I think is pretty good. Not too sweet and not too bland, but there is a distinct mango and pineapple tropical taste."
2189,B007I7Z3Z0,A38BEIB5NCPXBR,"Stori Diva ""Stori Gurl""",5,"This is not the first time I've used  Lipton Green tea to-go products, but Blackberry Pomegranate Green tea is a new flavor.  For the most part ,most of these are virtually the same, but I have to say that I have always a high taste for anything blackberry. I don't taste the pomegranate as much as I do the blackberry and that's a plus for me, but for those die hard POM drinkers it might not be so likable.<br />Would buy this product again? Absolutely. Especially since I SHOULD drink more water but won't unless its flavored. This give my water the boost I like and it only has five calories per serving.  I highly recommend it."
2190,B007I7Z3Z0,A35JP8KSV9281K,bezoarrn,5,Delicious and refreshing with a fresh mango taste. I can't taste the pineapple at all which is too bad because I got this specifically for that. I'm not a big mango fan but this taste great. The green tea is just right. I plan on buying this on a regular basis.
2191,B007I7Z3Z0,A2ANTZGPEINGVY,David Johnson,5,"I'm picky about iced tea and haven't been a huge fan of Lipton in the past, nor am I very fond of powered drink mixes. I thought I'd give these a try since I'm on the go lately and don't have time to make proper iced tea. They are EXCELLENT. Just sweet enough, but very fruity, almost like the tea with flavored syrup you get in restaurants. I'm addicted to these now and can't go back to the hum-drum Crystal Lite flavors. The other flavors are great too - my favorite being Blackberry Pomegranate. I'm so sick of the same ol' same ol' Lemonade, Raspberry Lemonade, Orangade, Strawberry Kiwi, etc. These flavors sound a bit odd at first, but the taste is crazy good.<br /><br />I should mention that the crystals are a little harder to break up in cold water than most single drink mixes. However, it clearly states this on the box and the extra effort is absolutely worth it."

It's so convenient to take of few of these with me at work or when I'm traveling.  And, I'm not ashamed to admit that I've even taken this into a restaurant with me, ordered a glass of water, and had a delicious tea with my meal for much less than I would pay for one of their drinks."
2194,B007I7Z3Z0,A1FVP6G8W3O8ZA,Arthur Kimes,5,I like the taste.  It's sweet - but not too sweet.  No aftertaste.  It's pleasant to drink chilled or at room temperature.<br /><br />If you like a refreshing tea drink you should try this!<br /><br />The only annoyance is that it's hard to mix.  I suggest sipping a little water from the bottle before pouring in the mix.  That'll make it easier to agitate.
2195,B007I7Z3Z0,A1XNZ7PCE45KK7,Og8ys1,5,"and I want to congratulate the graphic artist for putting the entire product name on such a small box.  The ad men must have really thought long and hard.<br /><br />But seriously, I love the product. The taste was refreshing and I thought that the taste was pleasing with no aftertaste.  Not too sweet and Goldilocks would have stopped right there if there was a choice of 3.  Easy to use as you just pour the contents into a 16 oz bottle of water and shake.  Mixed well, no granulation, you really couldn't ask for anything more and Lipton like a good drug dealer knows what they are doing, give me a taste for free and have me for life.  5 stars."
2196,B007I7Z3Z0,A9ESHA5MS6S6L,Sherry Lochner,5,"What an easy and refreshing drink!  I did it in my glass, but it was a yummy change to the normal water that I drink.  Love that it is made with honey, and the strawberry acai blend was delish!"
2197,B007I7Z3Z0,A2OW356OMJNAVH,BMAR,5,This drink mix was a refreshing treat.  It was just tart enough and just sweet enough to provide a nice fruity drink.  I completely forgot that this was a green tea mix.  It reminded me of a light cranberry-apple flavor.  I'll definitely buy this one again and again.<br /><br />Loved it!

It dissolved quickly and cleanly with no lumps or clumping.  It is favorful without being overpowering.  The mix of blackberry and pomegranate was intriguing but not too tart or sweet.  It is making me into a fan."
2199,B007I7Z3Z0,A39WWMBA0299ZF,"C. Hamilton ""Latsyrc728""",5,"The first thing I check with any flavored drink is the nutrition facts (I want to eat my carbs and calories, not drink them!) There are 2gm sugar, 10 calories and 2gm of carbs per packet (it is listed as 1/2 packet per serving, but that is unrealistic). One packet makes about 16oz prepared. Each box comes with 10 packets. The packets are made with real tea leaves and sweetened with honey. This mix does not contain Aspartame, it is sweetened with honey and Sucralose (equivalent of Splenda). The Strawberry Acai flavor is decaffeinated.<br /><br />Full Ingredient List: Honey Granules (Sugar, Honey), Malic Acid (Provides Tartness), Decaffeinated Green Tea Powder, Hibiscus Extract, Maltodextrin (Corn), Sucralose (Sweetener), Natural Flavor, Strawberry Juice Solids, Acai Juice Solids<br /><br />As far as taste goes, it has a really nice and sweet Strawberry flavor with a hint of honey. I personally can't taste the Acai. I also verily taste the tea. It is more of a strawberry drink with a slight tea and honey flavor. It is really good. However, if you are expecting lightly flavored tea, this one is not for you. It is also on the sweet side. I personally prefer sweet drinks and it is perfect for me. If you prefer your drinks not as sweet, plan on adding more water.<br /><br />I definitely like this flavor and will buy more. I do wish it had caffeine, but I can stick to this in the evening hours. It makes a nice alternative to water. While I would recommend this, I like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007I7Z0T4"">Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Blackberry Pomegranate, 10-Count (Pack of 12)</a> flavor better (it is caffeinated).

You can really taste the honey-kissed flavor in this mix in variety. I can honestly say it's my new favorite diet green tea (sorry, Snapple, you've been trumped.). Yummy!"
2201,B007I7Z3Z0,A28SBPF6KFZ7VL,"Eric A. Klee ""eak321""",5,"Lipton's new packets of Iced Green Tea with Honey and Blackberry Pomegranate are delicious, refreshing, and light-tasting.  Plus, they're only 5 calories per packet.  Obviously, they're very similar to (and probably a direct competition for) Crystal Light's to-go packets.  Naturally, Lipton offers tea flavors.<br /><br />The instructions say to add one full packet to 16 oz. of water, but I used twice the water it recommended for one packet, and it's still very flavorable and super-sweet.  If you're going to use a glass of water or small bottle of water, I'd recommend trying only half a packet (or less) to start.  There are honey granules (sugar and honey) that dissolve and sweeten the water.  The packaging touts that there's no aspartame (Equal) in these like Crystal Light, but there is sucralose listed as an ingredient, which is another artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Most importantly, though, is that these new Lipton packets, like Crystal Light packets, give your water a little boost of flavor and, in the case of green tea, flavonoids.  If you're trying to eliminate sodas from your diet and are tired of drinking ""just"" water, try these little packets.  You'll still be drinking the water, but you'll have a flavor boost that won't make you feel like you're drinking ""just"" water."

This one is very nice.  There is a very strong taste of honey, which I love.  The strawberry and acai taste is mild and not overwhelming.  If you like the taste of honey, you will like this.  If you don't like honey, then this product probably is not for you.<br /><br />I will buy these again.  I  didn't feel thirsty after drinking it and it didn't have a horrible aftertaste, as some of these products do.<br /><br />Great product."

To Go drinks also provide a nice flavor break when travelling aboard in countries where the water is not safe and all you want to drink is bottled water.<br /><br />And I do enjoy Lipton's To Go Stix Iced Green Team Mix, Team and Mango Pineapple product. The mango and pineapple tastes dominated enough that I really could not taste the green tea but that didn't matter that much. I enjoyed the health benefits of green tea without the taste.<br /><br />The product has 5 calories per 8 ounce serving as it relies on honey for sweetening and real fruit flavors. And  do appreciate that the product does not have aspartame, the artificial sweetening chemical once sold under the brand name NutraSweet that may or may not be harmful, depending upon whom you listen to.

Since I've been hearing and reading about the benefits of tea, especially green tea, I decided to give this product a try in the hopes that it would help me overcome my antipathy.<br /><br />My plan seems to be working.  Lipton has mixed its green tea with honey, mango and pineapple, a mixture which is more than just palatable but actually delicious.  It has no hint of the ""medicine"" taste which I've always associated with tea and serving it iced on a warm day is so refreshing.  The stix are convenient either for home use or for traveling so it can be enjoyed wherever you go.  I definitely intend to include this tea in my summer beverage consumption."

I guess I'm just not a fan of making a bottle at a time.

In fact if I was going on vacation I'd take these packets of iced tea mix with me. One packet works well in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water but it tastes even better stirred into a glass of water with ice. The message you get when you read the front of the box is that this is going to be all natural with just honey sweetening your tea. That is not exactly true. This contains honey granules (made from honey and sugar), sucralose and maltodextrin. This also contains green tea powder, hibiscus extract and natural flavor (mango and pineapple). If you made this tea with only 8 ounces of water as it suggests then this tea would be very sweet. It needs about double that amount of water to taste normal. So really if you add this to a normal bottle of water it will still be only five calories per drink. I also like that this does not have aspartame in it. The flavor is great and if you don't mind a little sugar this might be a satisfying drink for the summer.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

I can't say I really taste the acai, but I do taste the honey. The convenience of either adding it to a glass of cold water or to a bottle of water for on-the-go is nice. I prefer decaf teas during the day so this is perfect. With only 5 calories and 1 gram of sugar, it's a much better option than sodas or high calorie fruit juices. I will definitely get this again."

These little tubes of Lipton to-go stix decaf iced green tea mix are convenient, and tasty.  The taste is a little to sweet for me so I use a half a tube per bottle of water or add ice cubes to help dilute it in a glass.  This is very tasty, not grainy at all as long as you shake or stir it well.  It is a great way to stay hydrated and mix up the taste of bland water when you are sick of it.  I would recommend these for any busy person, to throw in your bag for a flavorful drink anytime and anywhere. I will buy these again and am looking forward to trying their other flavors."

The instructions call for 16.9 ounces of water, but I put it in about 22 ounces (which is what I usually do with powdered mixes that call for less water). This has a little honey, sugar, as well as sucralose (splenda)in it. That's why it's only 5 calories per packet. I would definitely buy this in the future."

It reminds me a lot of the taste you get from Crystal Lights brand Raspberry Ice flavor. I made it with hot water from my tea pot, then after it got room temperature I put it in the fridge. I have to say it tasted good hot too. If you add 2 quarts of water to your pitcher and then add 4 of these little packets you'll have 2 quarts ready to drink instead of using just one little packet with 16 ounces of water. You'd need ice to add too that way to make it cold enough so I'll just make it my way, 2 quarts at a time... You can always fill your empty water bottle with it before you go where ever your going and you can save the big bucks and use your home drinking water instead of paying to buy water in a bottle."

The thing that surprises me is that they are 5 calories...which is really good.  Because unlike some low-calorie drinks, this has NO aspartame.  So no icky aftertaste and no scary chemical either.  Just a good mildly-sweet tea blend (not over the top cloyingly sweet).  I was surprised because I usually hate flavored teas, and just opt for unsweetened black or green tea.<br />This is refreshing and light, and I like that's it green tea because green tea is supposed to be healthy for you...I just better not drink this with an order of fries, LOL.<br />I'm putting a few of these in my purse for when cold water doesn't do the trick.

We were excited to try this as they all love ice tea, but surprisingly it was not the biggest hit in my house. My husband, who loves honey and has been on a honey kick lately, said that it ""tastes like Kool-Aid"". He did drink it but said that he wouldn't be likely to purchase it. My children liked it a bit better than my husband did but they prefer products more like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4FUHG"">MIO Strawberry Watermelon, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>.

It is easy to mix up with a glass of water, and does not take long to dissolve.<br /><br />Why only 3 stars? Well, first because it really does not taste like tea, more like berry kool-aid. The second reason is that though the words ""tea & honey"" are splashed all over the product box and the packet, you'd expect that 1) it tastes a little like tea, 2) you could taste the honey, 3) honey is the only sweetener.  I've already talked about it failing point 1. You can faintly taste the honey - it's not overpowering, and was a nice taste. Point 2 in its favor. Now onto point 3; the ingredients are as follows: honey granules (sugar, honey), citric acid (provides tartness), green tea powder, hibiscus extract, sucralose (sweetener), maltodextrin (corn), natural flavor, blackberry juice solids, isomalt, soy lecithin, pomegranate juice solids. I see 3 sweeteners other than the honey granules: sucralose, maltodextrin, and isomalt. Point 3 against this product. Serving size is also misleading - you'd think one packet is one serving. Wrong, one packet is 2 servings. Not really a big deal, but it might be for some.<br /><br />I'll enjoy the drink, but not sure that I would be eager to go out and purchase it right away."

So I can't even taste it to tell you how it tastes.<br /><br />When a product description says ""naturally sweetened with honey"" And the second ingredient IS honey, WHY why why why throw in an artificial sweetner? That's like adding peach flavour to a slice of peach. Why make something that IS healthy, unhealthy and more expensive to produce by adding unnecessary ingredients?<br /><br />Depending on how you feel about Stevia, try the True Orange/True Lemon products...or enjoy your plain water :-) That's the way I'm going to go."
2242,B007I7Z3Z0,AF03NDXR2PIFX,B. Wilson,2,"I think that this Liptons To Go Green Tea Mix tastes OK, but I prefer real tea. My wife likes this Lipton's Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix. She likes the mild strawberry flavor.<br /><br />But it is not as natural as Lipton advertises. Lipton's product info states, ""Lipton Tea & Honey ... is a low calorie iced tea mix you can feel good about simply because it's made with real ingredients ... blended with honey and strawberry and acai flavors ... Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors ... flavor with other natural flavor ... and no aspartame.""<br /><br />So what's there to not like about that? Well it's not all real ingredients and sweetened with just honey. The fine print discloses that it includes Sucralose (sweetener). Shane Ellison calls himself ""The People's Chemist"" and is the author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402225059"">Over the Counter Natural Cures: Take Charge of Your Health in 30 Days with 10 Lifesaving Supplements for under $10</a>. Shane was a big pharma chemist who quit when he discovered that the drugs that he was creating for the big pharma companies were nothing more than toxins and the real cures were natural and didn't require a prescription. Shane says that artificial sweeteners like Sucralose (Splenda) have serious problems. Studies show that they lead to weight gain and even pre-diabetes. Artificial sweeteners ""disrupt the body's natural calorie counter"" and ""put the users at much higher risk for being obese and insulin resistant."" Shane says that Sucralose, 1,6-Dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-'-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-'-D-galactopyranoside, contains a historically deadly, nasty form of chlorine (RNFOC), which yields poisons such as insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides. ""An RNFOC can invade every nook and cranny of the body ... and may result in weakened immune function, irregular heartbeat, agitation, shortness of breath, skin rashes, headaches, liver and kidney damage, birth defects, and cancer. Hiding its origin, sucralose pushers assert that it is 'made from sugar'. Sucralose is as close to sugar as glass cleaner is to purified water. France recently banned such false advertising statements. The deceit has been ignored within the United States.""<br /><br />Why does the FDA allow this? Shane says science was sold out for profit. ""Just like chemists manipulate the properties of matter, Big Pharma manipulates studies using 'checkbook science.' This allows them to pay for the design and interpretation of clinical trials. Checkbook science isn't illegal by FDA standards. It's been going on for over 20 years. Known as the Bayh-Dole Act, US law was amended in 1980 to permit flagrant conflicts of interest, ones that allow the industry to design drug trials and hire experts to conjure up favorable results at will.""<br /><br />So if you want something natural, look for Shane Ellison's book and skip this Lipton's tea mix."

However, as soon as I tasted it I knew there was ""fake sugar"" in it- I could taste the artificial sweetener but could not taste the honey at all.  I turned the package over and sure enough, one of the listed ingredients was sucralose, which is found in Splenda.  I think the label is a bit misleading because it gives the impression that only honey is used to sweeten the product which is not the case.  The box says it does not contain aspartame, which is true, but sucralose is not much better for you and still has an artificial taste.  I didn't like this so I wouldn't buy it again, and truthfully, I would rather buy this product if it was sweetened with ONLY honey or real sugar, even if that meant it had more calories.  A spoonful of sugar only has about 20 calories- if they put one spoonful per pack and each pack makes two glasses of beverage, it would still be a low-calorie drink, it would taste better and would be more natural."

I had thought this would be a product I'd enjoy as mango and pineapple are two of my favorites when it comse to fresh fruit or smoothies; I've also been a Lipton tea customer for years, and have never been disappointed in their products. I even enjoy honey on occasion as a more natural sweetener, and was curious to see how these flavors would combine.<br /><br />This one was such a disappointment that I gave away what was left in my sampler box (my friends and family didn't care for it either). Now I liked the convenience of the stix, and have appreciated what companies have done in order to give you a somewhat cheaper form of ""flavored water"" so I thought Lipton might have had something.<br /><br />The honey was so prominent and overly sweet that it pretty much wrecked the remaining flavors; it also had a slight chemical tinge which left me with a horrible after-taste in the end. What there was of the mango and pineapple was not the fresh taste I had hoped for, but something with a disgusting artificiality that did not play up a combination which does work very well under most circumstances (such as when I've made up my own mixture); again there was way more artificial sweetness (and this is coming from a Southern girl who loves sweet iced tea on occasion). Even the fragrance was sickening and overpowering. The color in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water was a straw-yellow -- not quite golden, not quite regular yellow, but I figured that meant it would be strong enough to give me the full flavor I desired without being too weak. As I mentioned, I could only take several sips; I think I drank 1/3 of a bottle in the end...and then I called it quits. I even refrigerated it for a bit, as if hoping everything needed time to ""merge""; after a few hours I tried again -- lost cause and down the drain it went.<br /><br />I don't know if the other flavors are an improvement, but I will never waste money to find out. Had the box I received NOT have been a sampler courtesy of Lipton, I would have demanded a refund. Back to the drawing board Lipton!"

2251,B007I7Z3Z0,A2DDVD6SPKZOZK,Calamity Jane,4,"My teenagers love green tea and anything with a funky flavor, so I got them the mango pineapple flavor of this Lipton To Go green tea mix. It's a great way to flavor plain water, which one of my boys hates to drink.<br /><br />They both liked it quite a bit and said it tastes just like the pre-made Lipton green tea bottles you buy in the store. I mixed up half a packet in an 8-ounce glass of water for myself, and it took some time for it to fully dissolve. The color is a bit weird...a yellowy orange. I could taste the mango and the pineapple, but with the honey, it had a bit too much going on for me, flavor-wise. Didn't seem that balanced. I wouldn't make it again for myself, but I'd buy it again for my boys. Flavor is such a personal thing, though, and there are SO many reviews on here with different opinions, so if you're an adventurous sort, try it for yourself. It didn't have a chemical taste to me, just a lot of flavors going on.<br /><br />In reading the other reviews, I don't understand why some people are FREAKING out about there being Splenda in it. So?? Many low-calorie drinks are sweetened with Splenda (sucralose) or Nutrasweet (aspartame), and Splenda is a much better alternative than Nutrasweet. If you don't like artificial sweeteners, then don't get this product! And read the label first...yes, it says there's no aspartame, which may lead people to believe there are NO artificial sweeteners, but a quick glance at the nutrition panel tells you it has sucralose. Those of us who are hypoglycemic appreciate having products with lower sugar available to us, because we have to give up most sweets. If you prefer things with Stevia, then buy unsweetened tea mixes and flavor them yourselves. Toss in a little pineapple juice and honey and knock yourself out. But just because this tea has Splenda doesn't make it a product worthy of scorn. To each his own!"

It's convenient and easy!  Well, that's what we have here - yet another contender in the powdered drink mix market.  In terms of being a powdered drink mix, it's okay. The packets open easily enough.  The only think I've noticed is that it takes longer to dissolve than some other ones I've tried in the past, but not excessively so.  It's also fairly low calorie, which is nice.  I'm sure you're all wondering, though, ""is it any good?""<br /><br />Well, at the end of the day, it all comes down to taste.  This is where it goes wrong.  It's got a slightly unpleasant undertone of bitterness and sourness to it that I didn't like.  I mean, it's not the most foul thing I've ever drank, but it's not the best either.  It sort of tastes like fake strawberries and fake honey, which is strange because it claims to be made with ""real ingredients"".  Oh, and even though it's supposedly sweetened with honey, it has added sucralose to it.  Go figure.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm starting to wonder if tea is something that was just meant to be brewed like normal instead of condensed down into a dissolvable powder.  In fact, the best ""to go"" packet drinks I've had were blatantly fake, but at least they tasted good.  So, do I recommend this drink powder?  Well, if you want a convenient drink powder, then I'd try some other brand.  Although you might like the taste better than I did, so I guess you'll just have to try it yourself!  If you just want tea, then you might be better off just making a big batch of tea and pouring it into some bottles."

This new iced tea by Lipton is just okay it is not really what I would call my preferred tea. I'm not sure if it is the honey or the strawberry but it has a funny aftertaste in my mouth. It definitely is a required taste that would take time to get used to, after one has acquired this case it might be very tasty, however I'm not much for a sweet tea. I have drank raspberry iced teas and have liked them but they to are an acquired taste. If you like flavored iced tea this is the tea for you!<br /><br />Try this iced tea at your own risk."

Mango Pineapple Green Tea is the flavor mixture in question.  I must say that the taste is really good and all the key ingredients shine through.  In other words, I can taste green tea, mango, pineapple and even a touch of honey, yet none of the flavors are too over bearing.<br /><br />These drink sticks (10 in a box) are 5 calories a serving and taste like they are much higher in calories. It took me a little extra effort to mix the powder into the water, but nevertheless the powder dissolved.  I must say there is a slight, slight aftertaste.  It isn't bad per se but it is worth noting.  I didn't find it to be a big deal or would prevent me from purchasing in the future, yet it should be noted.<br /><br />I believe that Lipton has stepped their game up with these drink mixes and I love the idea that green tea is being utilized.  Green tea is underrated so it is nice that it is being promoted more."

And the other brands have less of an aftertaste.  But the primary reason for the average rating is that this powder doesn't dissolve easily in water.  I had to stir quite a bit yet sometimes there were still small clumps of powder floating in the drink. I've never had that problem with competitive products and for that reason alone I'm unlikely to buy this product in the future."

Personally, I think water tastes just fine the way it is, but since I'm also a tea drinker (in mass quantity) I thought I'd try this. It's OK, it's fine, I have no complaints about the taste, though it's a bit on the too sweet side. The taste is kind of familiar and I'm not really sure what it reminds me of, but it tastes a bit like a melted popsicle or like Jello. In fact, it tastes a lot like licking jello powder off of your fingers, come to think of it--which is to say that it's not a bad taste by any means, and kids will probably like it. Also, if like me you drink too much sugar, you might want to give this a try mixed with club soda or seltzer--I imagine it would be good that way. One packet only has five calories. Would I go out of my way to buy it? Probably not, but you never know :) I'm going to try making ice cubes from it next :)"
2262,B007I7Z3Z0,A2RW587355CMVA,almosthappy,3,"The Lipton To Go Stix Strawberry Acai drink has a very pleasant flavor.  Unlike some flavor additives for water (cough...Mio...cough), these are not overly sweet.  The flavor is very well-balanced and refreshing.  Unfortunately, the flavor doesn't really taste like tea at all.  For some people, this might be desirable, but I would imagine that most people buying this product would be expecting the green tea flavor to come through more strongly.  In addition, the mix is slow to dissolve.  It didn't seem that any amount of stirring/shaking would completely eliminate the powder.  Over time, the powder dissolves more on its own, but this is definitely not ideal for an instant drink mix.  Overall, I'd say this is worth a try, but not quite living up to the quality I'd hoped for."
2263,B007I7Z3Z0,AKJHHD5VEH7VG,Dominique W,3,"First I want to say that one packet is way too much for 8oz of water. I used 2 packets with 2-quarts of water and this brings a nice, light flavor that does not taste artificial. Using one packet in a bottle of water would make me choke.<br /><br />Second, don't put these packets into your purse or bag.  The starter cut that allows for easy opening of the package is too deep.  I had taken the box to work with me.  When I realized I needed to mix the powder in greater quantity, I put three packets into my work bag.  Between leaving the office and arriving home (with the majority of the trip the bag sat on the passenger seat of my car), all three were open and I had powder everywhere.<br /><br />Lastly, the powder does not completely dissolve, even mixing with more water.  It could be that vigorous shaking of the product in a water bottle would help dissolve better than a spoon in a glass pitcher, but I would expect it to eventually dissolve either way, and this is not the case.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is good but only if you dilute it tremendously.  I was reading another review regarding the sweeteners and there are some excellent points to contemplate in that review.  I'm not even going to discuss what is on the label.  I'm just basing my opinion off my direct experience.<br /><br />My rating is a 3-star.  Had I used as directed, it would probably be a 1-star."
2264,B007I7Z3Z0,AK9FTWLCW09RR,Techie Evan,3,"Each packet of this Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Mango Pineapple is actually good for two servings, according to the printed instructions on the packet.  This was just fine with me since I don't like my drink to be too sweet.  So I tend to just pour a half-packet's worth of contents into a glass filled with very cold water each time I want to use this product, then give the mix a good stir.<br /><br />The drink tastes sweet.  I can discern the tea but not the mango or pineapple.  There is a hint of honey, but the drink's sweetness is probably due to the sucralose, which is listed as the fourth ingredient.  I didn't discern an aftertaste.  Overall, I think it's a fine drink.  Nothing really special to get excited about."

The dilution eliminates the cloying sweetness of honey granules and sucralose, allowing the green tea powder and citric acid to bring the right amount of tartness to the mix.<br /><br />Lipton's new drink tastes better than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4CCSQ"">MIO Liquid Peach Tea</a> and should please Crystal Light fans. Personally, I don't enjoy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9SS"">Crystal Light Green Tea Peach Mango Drink Mix</a> unless I find it as a fountain drink (again, the addition of crushed ice helps a bunch). Peach flavored instant tea is more common to find but I like Lipton's decision to pair mango and pineapple.<br /><br />Patience is important because the honey granules take additional time to break down into the water. Adding crushed ice helps blend the powder mix faster than with water alone.<br /><br />Lipton's box states that the drink is five calories per 8 oz serving with 60 mg tea flavonoids.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.<br /><br />BTW: Please be gentle with the video review. It was a family production. My 9-year old son, Kai, handled the filming and my 7-year son, Kou, was a taste tester."

The tea granules didn't dissolve easily at all and I had to ""mash"" them against the side of the cup several times to get them to mix. However, this was expected. The instructions on the box says to put the powder into a 16 oz. bottle and shake. We don't use plastic bottles so that wasn't an option. The mix did completely dissolve, eventually.<br /><br />I found the flavor way too sweet for my taste. That's pretty impressive since it's supposed to be only 5 calories, makes me wonder about the amount of artificial sweeteners. The blackberry was all I tasted. I kinda missed the pomegranate and tea flavors though. I detected no honey flavor.<br /><br />I'll drink it again, but I'll dilute it more."

I would love to not be constantly purchasing all the big jugs, and the idea of having something that generates less trash is incredibly appealing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he thought there were ""too many different flavors"" in this, and he suggested I let the kids have the rest of the box.  He also complained about a funny aftertaste.  I chalked it up to him just being picky.<br /><br />The kids liked the flavor.  Their complaint was that it is pretty much impossible to mix in a glass (in a water bottle it was easy though).  And they also complained of a funny aftertaste.<br /><br />With all of that, though, they did continue to ask for more until the box was empty.<br /><br />So, mixed reviews from my family."

Instead, I feel as though I received a strawberry flavored water drink less any sort of tea and honey flavor.  For those of you who might have tried other products similar to this (Crystal Light) it is very close to the same in my opinion.  Now, if you hate plain water this might be perfect for you!  Just don't expect a dramatic taste difference because the words ""Tea & Honey"" are printed on the box.<br /><br />The product does not always ""completely"" dissolve unless you keep stirring or really shake your water bottle but I didn't notice those particles mattered while drinking it.  You could just see small pieces that didn't completely dissolve at the bottom of your cup/bottle of water.<br /><br />The small packets are easy to use, just tear the corner and add to water.

My husband, who loves honey and has been on a honey kick lately, said that it ""tastes like Kool-Aid"". He did drink it but said that he wouldn't be likely to purchase it.

The positive is this Lipton Green Tea in Honey, Mango Pineapple flavor is true to taste, offering a real sweet combination of the three flavors.  The negative is that I just couldn't get past the disinct aftertaste from the sucralose additive.  I've tried other lo cal drink mixes, and all basically offer the same flavors with artificial sweeteners to save on the calories.

I was excited to try this product because I am always short on time and thought a powdered, just add water mix would be great.  One major problem, this ""tea"" has zero tea flavor.  It also claims to be ""sweetened with honey"" but it is actually sweetened with sucralose in addition to ""honey granules"".  Because of this, it has a very strong ""diet"" aftertaste, something I am not fond of at all.  Overall the drink was far too sweet for my liking even though I made it with 20oz of water instead of the 16 recommended.  I was really disappointed by this product.  I also feel the packaging is hugely misleading.  It says, and I quote; ""Sweetened with honey"" with no mention of the sucralose.  It does mention ""no aspartame"" but fails to mention it's other source of sweetness.  The ingredients are as follows: Honey granules (sugar, honey), Citric acid, green tea powder, sucralose, malodextrin, hibiscus extract, natural flavor, and Beta carotene for color.  As far as powdered diet drinks go, this one would be low on my list.  Even drinks like Crystal light do not have this strong of a diet aftertaste."

This is personal preference.  If you like your iced tea very sweet, you'll probably like this.  I personally like about half the sweetener.

I have used plenty of drink sticks and discovered some are better than others.  This blend is by Lipton and the flavor is a decaf green tea with honey and strawberry acai.  The name of this flavor seems like a pretty robust title to live up to.<br /><br />I must say that the flavor is really good, not too sweet but sweet enough.  None of the flavors are overpowering yet all of them are present.  The beverage is only 5 calories a serving and has no caffeine, which is alright in my book.  My only complaint is that it took me quite a while to mix this powder into the water.  I am not sure why that was the case, but in the large scheme of things this is a minor issue.  For someone who is looking for a good way to spice up their water without too many calories, this drink by Lipton might be a good solution."
2274,B007I7Z3Z0,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""",3,"There's only one thing keeping me from giving this a solid 4 star rating: the aftertaste, which I'll get more into later.<br /><br />First, the good. Other than the aftertaste, this tastes pretty good. I can pick out the different flavors of pomegranate, blackberry, honey, and tea, and they don't clash with each other. They're well blended together for the most part and this is pretty awesome with a lot of ice.<br /><br />It's just that the aftertaste ruins it. There's this slight chemical taste to the product that really interferes with the other flavors, making it so I am unable to forget that this is a powdered mix. It isn't something that would keep me from drinking the tea, but with how well everything else works together it's pretty noticeable. Again, this isn't something that I'd say would keep me from going out and purchasing it on my own, just something I hope that Lipton works on in the future.<br /><br />Aside from this, I only had one gripe that did not detract from the product itself and I didn't change the ratings for this at all. I'm just really irritated at the packaging saying that this is a 5 calorie beverage. It is, but only if you plan on using half of the packet. This is something that is standard for most companies and it's really irritating since the majority of consumers will use the entire packet and many will count the entire beverage as 5 calories when it's really 10. It's not as big of a deal here as it is with some of the more sugared products with higher calorie and carb counts, but this is sort of misleading unless you're someone who scours the nutritional and serving information on everything you buy.<br /><br />Overall though, this is something I'd probably go out and buy with my own money.<br /><br />3.4/5"

Answer - BAD.<br /><br />This tea is more like kool-aid than flavored tea.<br />The color is a medium pinkish red, not anything like tea and more like kool-aid.<br />The taste is overly fruity, with hardly any tea taste at all.

Essentially, you can take these little packets anywhere, pour it into a (standard 16.9 fl. oz.) bottle of water, and enjoy some tea. It's quick and easy, but unfortunately these Tea & Honey packets don't seem to actually work very well.<br /><br />The box warns, ""Tea takes longer to dissolve so SHAKE WELL."" This, however, is a pretty big understatement in my experience. After pouring the powder in, I shook the bottle a couple times and found that the powder clumped together immediately. I shook and shook and shook, but to no avail. Certainly, it flavored the water, but there were also big sugar-particles floating around my bottle. I tried it once more but to the same result.<br /><br />It's really a shame because the taste is quite good, much like a pomegranate flavored-water. But along with this good taste, your mouth is filled with an unpleasant amount of sugar clumps. Of course, it would be possible to filter these out with a strainer of some kind, although that would totally defeat the convenience aspect of the product. It's unfortunate."

When I saw this offering and it claimed to be natural I became very interested.  From a packaging stand point, I love the way these little packets can be thrown in a glove compartment, purse, diaper bag or book bag.  They travel well and open easily.<br /><br />Upon opening the packet I would pour the powder into a standard water bottle (16.9 fl oz.) and shake very very vigorously.  I found that if the water was not ice cold and I did not continue to shake vigorously for a minute then there would be flavor crystal sediment on the bottom.  If the water was ice cold, the powder would incorporate well.  The color does stain, so that may be a concern for some.  Now for the flavor aspect...  Personally this Iced Green Tea mix is just too sweet and artificial flavored.  From the first sip I was assaulted by a cloyingly sweet and rather sickening flavor.  I resorted to sort of holding my breath and guzzling down.  When it came to the last quarter of the bottle I would always dump it; just too sweet.  For me, it tasted very much like what I remember red Kool-Aid tasting like when I was young.  I personally don't allow my children to drink red Kool-Aid.  They loved this stuff!  A bit too enthusiastically for my liking.  They would fight over the bottle, which was just plain odd.  Two days passed and when I returned to the cabinet I had discovered that the kids has been sneaking the packets and polished off the whole box.  My husband on the other hand, hated it and he loves sweet drinks.  He didn't like the sweet 'fake' aftertaste (his words).<br /><br />If you like very very sweet tasting drinks and prefer when drinks have that fake 'aspartame' taste then this should be a winner for you.  Our kids aged 9, 8 and 5.5 loved it.  They found it easy enough to mix on their own apparently.  I just wish that the product was a bit more natural and less 'diet'.<br /><br />Recommend only if you fit the the profile of a customer that would enjoy it.  If you love Kool-Aid mixed with way too many portions then you might just enjoy this.  Kudos on the packaging, which is very much like Crystal Light... thumbs down on a very kiddie oriented flavor profile.  Blackberry pomegranate sounds very adult... Kool-Aid not so much."

Malic acid, maltodextrin, and sucralose are pretty much the only things my tongue registered. I think you'd have to be a professional food taster with an incredibly refined set of taste buds to recognize any hint of green tea or honey.<br /><br />What i really can't grasp is why they bothered putting any real sugar in this in the first place. Why not make it 0 calorie and skip the sugar entirely, instead of putting the 10 calories (per packet, which is two servings, hence 'only 5 calories per serving!') in with no effect whatsoever on the taste of the product.<br /><br />And worse yet, if they're going to grossly oversweeten it, why not use a zero-calorie sweetener like stevia that doesn't taste like a chemical factory exploded on your tongue?<br /><br />People who consume enough fake sugar that they've lost the negative reaction to the chemical aftertaste of those products will probably find this product pleasantly sweet and fruity.

You don't have to worry about mixing it, as the package states, as it dissolves well and whatever is left over will dissolve in the next serving anyway.  I found myself going to the water cooler about two to three times more often than normal because it tastes so good.

The first sip it tasted watered down because I didn't use the whole package but at the same time it is overly sweet. Tastes like sugar water. I went ahead and put the whole package in, and it did darken the water to a nice burgundy color. With the whole package in it, it does give it more of a flavor and doesn't taste watered down, but it is still sweet. It has a weird after taste and I taste no honey at all. I do kind of taste the pomegranate but I don't really taste any tea or honey. Every morning I have hot lipton black tea and add honey. So, I know what tea with honey tastes like and this is not it.<br /><br />The weird after taste really gets to me. I don't know what it is but it distracts from the overall taste and makes me not want to really drink it. I don't know how to really describe it, almost a cardboard taste to it. It is funky."
2286,B007I7Z3Z0,A2UT0FWM1DHKFJ,Rare's Reviews,3,"While this is a tasty tea I found that it was a little too sweet for one 16 oz bottle of water. I put it into a larger cup and diluted it a bit more which brought out the mango and pineapple flavors more. It still has a ""diet"" aftertaste which I'm not thrilled about, but I do appreciate that it doesn't have aspartame in it. These handy packets would be good to travel with, especially when traveling abroad where you shouldn't drink anything other than bottled water. I also thought that the nutritional information is a little misleading. The front of the package boasts that it's only five calories per 8 oz serving, but these are made to be poured directly into a 16 oz bottle of water so in reality there are two servings per packet, making it ten calories. Not a lot of a difference, but for a calorie counting person it is a difference."
2287,B007I7Z3Z0,A8NVUTR71EW0W,"Steven A. Godun ""sgodun""",3,"What I expected: Something that tasted like green tea with perhaps a hit of honey, strawberry, and acai flavor, finished with the typical sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />What I got: A pleasant tasting strawberry soft drink with very little sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the taste of this drink is quite nice. The strawberry flavor is quite fresh-tasting and at room temperature is very fragrant. It's just not at all what I'd expect for a product from Lipton calling itself ""Green Tea Mix"". The powder dissolves very quickly, even when stirred with a spoon in an open glass (vs shaken in a bottle).<br /><br />So why only three stars? Like I said, I expected green tea. I got strawberry drink. If you're looking for strawberry, this is very good. If you're looking for tea, move along."

2289,B007I7Z3Z0,A2YPB8IOEU10XJ,"crazyoaks ""crazyoaks""",4,"This came in a small box of ten foil packages three inches long and a half-inch wide.  There is a cut at one end that allows you to open the foil package so none of the usual difficulties with getting these things open just to spill out some of the contents. The package says to mix with one 16-ounce bottle of water.<br /><br />The powder mixed into the water completely by the time I was ready to put the lid on to shake it up.  It turned the water a light pink.  This flavor of Stix To Go does not have aspartame in it.  The box says sweetened with honey and indeed honey granules are the first ingredients, however there is also sucralose, similar to Splenda.  There is also maltodextrin, which is often used in soda or candy as a thickener, but it is made from real food not chemicals.  The other ingredients are the flavors and hibiscus extract.  WebMD says that hibiscus extract is used to improve odor, flavor, and appearance of tea.  The package also says that a serving size is half of a package at five calories, but you are told to add the whole package to a bottle of water, so beware if you are counting calories.<br /><br />The taste is not bad.  I do not drink anything with artificial sweeteners because I cannot stand the aftertaste, but I did not notice an aftertaste with this.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it did not last.  If think you are getting tea you are not.  This taste like kid's strawberry drink.  If you just can't drink water then you would probably like this."
2290,B007I7Z3Z0,A26KXNN6H1IL0I,A. Tegtmeier,1,"This product is sometimes advertised as having no aspertame in it, which is true. But it still has an artificial sweetener in it - sucralose. So instead of Satan, you are getting the Devil here ... and they also let this product sailing under a false flag, by putting ""Tea&Honey"" in BIG letters up front. So naturally, you might think that this is an actual healthy product, organic even. Just read the ingredients list and you will quickly recognize what it really is: sugared water with some flavors in it.<br />But, not deterred by that, I prepared a glass for a brave self-mutilating test - YIKES.<br />Artificial taste, very sweet, immediate scratching and itching in the back of my throat, chemical aftertaste, just totally and utterly horrible.<br />Blackberry/Pomegranate? Yeah, I guess if you know what the label claims it should taste like, you could actually imagine that for a second or two - there is a hint of that in this drink, but at a very faint level. It has some, well, mummified blackberries in it, too, but that is an almost comical detail.<br />And something else happened to me, which was already described by other reviewers - as soon as I opened the package, a very fine dust emitted which immediately made me cough and gasp for air. I just hope, this stuff is just bad tasting and not toxic on top of it ...<br />Very rarely, I bemoan the  fact that Amazon makes you give at least one star. For this product, I would like to have the opportunity to give no star at all ..."

This flavor stick leaves an aftertaste in my mouth that I didn't like very much.  I have had some better tasting flavors (see my review for the Lipton strawberry flavor).  I really couldn't get past the after taste.  I probably will not be getting this flavor again.
2292,B007I7Z3Z0,A3GQSZ2RVVXDCZ,Jon Kreisler,3,"Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix is convenient and refreshing. One ""stick"" makes 16 oz of iced tea when mixed with water. (Note, the nutrition information shown on the package is for 8 oz, so you need to double the nutritional values if you consume the whole beverage.)<br />The tea crystals do not dissolve easily, it will take some time to do it right. The flavor is variable, from sweet to sour to bitter at times.<br />The sweeteners include honey, sugar and suclarose (Splenda.) Blackberry and pomegranate is an odd combination,  but is not too bad. The packets are small and easy to carry around with you. If you like, you can just dissolve a packet into a 16 oz container of bottled water on the go. It is an ok drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
2293,B007I7Z3Z0,A2MSQNPTNAAGL1,P. Cannon,1,"Tea&Honey hmmm sounds like it might be all natural but it's NOT. Before I even opened this box, the smell of it turned me off. I poured this into 20 ounces of water which was even more then the 16 oz it called for and then tasted it, GACK, this is clearly not honey!  One swallow and I tasted this in my throat and mouth for an hour and the after taste is horrible. Even the glass I poured it out of, I couldn't get the smell out of even after washing it. This is so putridly sweet I could barely swallow it. I assumed this was as the front of the box said in BIG letters Tea&Honey, well it's not just sweetened with honey. The misleading product labeling did not clearly state that this is full of Sucralose (Nutrasweet by another name) and Maltodextrin two products I would NEVER put in my body knowingly. Both make me sick and give me migraines. Question is WHY? Why would you put artificial garbage, chemical sweetener in green tea that was already sweetened with sugar and honey?<br /><br />Lipton, this product is very misleading. You should Clearly state ""Artificial Sweetener"" and or ""Diet"" on the FRONT of the package so people who care what they put in their bodies won't buy this by mistake. Can't you just keep it all natural?"
2294,B007I7Z3Z0,A19PP48H5WFFKR,lucienne,1,"So, I thought I was getting a great deal on this product. My fault I guess for not reading the reviews and just going by the Lipton description: ""sweetened with honey"". Sucralose ... ""Splenda"" is the actual sweetener NOT honey. The sickening artificial taste ruins what could have been a lovely product. Splenda is not a natural product, has no relation to honey and along with other reviews - also gives me fierce migraines. For an added kick, these are not available for returns. Shame on Lipton! Last Lipton product I will ever buy!"

It was a rather nasty experience overall, really, but it saved itself from one star because the actual fruit and green tea flavours were really quite nice."

The other two I tried were actually fairly good but this one had an awful flavor to it. Doesn't even remotely taste like what strawberry anything would taste like. I would buy a different flavor.
2299,B007I7Z3Z0,AKJ87ZCIKUASO,"J. Hundley ""katies phil""",2,"Rather a disappointment, really. Overly sweet, this is more like honey-mango-pineapple Kool-aide.

The immediate smell when I first opened the package brought me back to sitting on the counter as a kid while my filled that huge green pitcher, right before we dumped that magical powder turning water into the sweet taste of my childhood.<br /><br />It may very well be sweetened with honey, but it still has a very slight saccharine taste. An odd thing about this drink mix is the variation in flavor depending on how much water you add to the mix. You have to go pretty light on the water if you want it to taste at all like tea, but that makes the saccharine taste a little too strong. Heavier on the water makes it taste like Kool-Aid. That's fine with me, because I like Kool-Aid. This may, however, be an expensive way to go about a glass."

Plain gets old quickly so I tried a sample of this product and immediately ordered the 12-pack. Pour it in - shake the bottle - and you're ready. Just that easy and the taste is great. Not too sweet and the mix of tea and lemon is just right for my taste. This will be a regular reorder item for me. A great price and quick delivery from Amazon makes it even better.

I love, love, love the taste and yes it is strong, I generally make it with 24 to 32 ounces of water, after ice has been added. It tastes just like the original Lipton tea stix before they changed to ""aspartame,"" a sweetener I have to avoid at all costs. If you'd had a migraine for 2 solid weeks with no relief, you would understand my joy.<br /><br />I will be buying this, this coming October and from then on, as I usually drink at least 2-3 glasses a day of this minimum. Thank you Lipton for listening to the needs of the many."
2303,B007I7Z3Z0,A341D838USLGKM,Daniel Greene,3,"This was my first drink mix and since then I've tried others to get a better sense if what I observed and tasted was present in all mixes or unique to Lipton's To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Honey, and Pomegranate. Overall, I immensely enjoyed the honey and pomegranate flavoring. It can be a tad sweet but you can always add water or use less mix to compensate. The only concern is the time it takes for the mix to dissolve. Many other mixes are able to dissolve almost instantly; however, with Lipton's, you've got to shake the drink for at least a good five minutes before the mix clumps completely breakdown otherwise you'll be feeling granules of mix grating in your mouth. Other than this, I think it's refreshing and tasty drink mix."
2304,B007I7Z3Z0,AKLIOBVXF45VY,jon,1,"as a tea, this stuff is terrible!<br /><br />However, you can use it to sweeten tea made from a tea bag & it is useful.<br />I wish I had not bought so much.  The Sucralose level is so high, that the artificial sweetning level is off the charts - in a bad way.  The tea flavor is not very good, but OK.  I tried diluting it more, but the tea becomes diluted & it just tast like weaker YUCK.  The lemon flavor is not mild either.  Needless to say, I'm not a fan of this product at all."
2305,B007I7Z3Z0,A2VJJ2POCLMED7,"Marshall Carter ""Ornery Gamer, Fiend Club Member""",3,"The Lipton To Go Stix Decaf iced tea mix is a convenient way to get your green tea mix in a hurry, but to be honest, you might want to go another route if you're really looking for green tea. There really wasn't all that much of a green tea flavor, although the strawberry acai is there and quite noticeable (I'm assuming these are artificial flavors). It tastes decent, but to be honest, this strikes me as being something closer to Kool Aid than ""tea."" It just doesn't taste all the natural to me, and if I'm drinking green tea, that's something I expect. It's not awful, and depending on the choices available, I'd probably drink it again.<br /><br />For those complaining about this having artificial, chemical sweeteners and that Lipton is falsely advertising this as being sweetened with honey, use some common sense. Honey has 22 calories per teaspoon and you'd need a whole lot more than one of them to sweeten a 16 ounce beverage. More or less all of the ""Stix"" type drink mixes have to use artificial sweeteners...the packaging is too small for a sugar or honey-sweetened mix."

The taste is smooth, clean, and slightly sweet with a mild Pineapple flavor.  Comparitively to say Davidson's it is more expensive, but a seems like a better quality tea.  However, compared to something like Teavana it's significantly less expensive, but not as tasty.

Then, you use as if it were salt on foods.<br /><br />The taste is aquired, and different than sushi type Nori or green kelp seaweed, but if it is for you, you have an electrolyte packed source for life! Affects thyroid (iodine) so check with your doctor if you have an issue, but, if not, is a great weight loss healthy aide.  Take apple cider vinegar (can be taken in pill form, it is only food, not medication) can be taken with the seaweed as an old-time diet aide.<br /><br />I guess you can figure out that I LOVE this stuff!

2338,B000AOV9BU,AX4PZ7IENWWA7,Ryan,5,"Not sayin anything new here, but the more positive reviews of this product the better.  I can't make the milk tea like the shops do back home but I can prepare the boba like they can thanks to this stuff.  I usually don't like buying things that are already done for me, or precooked, etc. but I'm glad these are out there for novice tea makers.  As far as them being chewy, I didn't know that they came any other way, so they are exactly as I expected boba pearls to be."

They don't come out quite as tender and even as the regular sort, but I actually prefer the chewy center. Good value for so much, considering this is the same price as about 4 cups of boba at most shops."
2340,B000AOV9BU,AJB20U71DGELW,qs777,5,"We've been ordering this for years after discovering them on Amazon.  We then switched to buying from the vendor directly since it's a good deal cheaper, but it also takes a few weeks to receive it.  We wanted it right away so ordered via Amazon and got it with super quick and prime shipping.  We're not disappointed and find it's worth the extra cost when the craving hits...<br /><br />2 shrink-wrapped packages come with the order.  We always place them in tight-fitting tupperware and only open one package at a time.  It lasts us a few months with no problem.  If it's not closed tightly enough, some of the ""pearls"" become so hard that they won't get chewy no matter how long they're boiled.<br /><br />We've found the following to be the perfect way to make boba minute  ""pearls"":<br /><br />In a small saucepan, add minute pearls to roiling boiling water;<br />let boil on high for 5 min longer -- they should all be floating at the top (check for chewiness / consistency);<br />remove / strain boba from hot water AND rinse off with cool water;<br />use in hot or cold tea immediately;<br />once boiled, cooked boba can store for about an hour after that the consistency just isn't right by our taste...<br /><br />Others tips -- we stir in some sugar on cooked bob a which for some reason seems to keep it longer and prevents it from sticking to each other into one big glob. Also, if you leave it in the hot water or over boil, it will melt and be a gooey / sticky mess ... Otherwise, it's just a perfect treat at a fraction of the time of regular Boba!"

The taste and consistency is better that way.<br /><br />Just don't let them soak for too long, they'll end up expanding too much and won't fit through a bubble tea straw."

They are extremely simple to make (simply add desired amount to boiling water and cook for 5 mins) and the texture is spot on: soft but nice and chewy. I have tried the WuFuYuan brand of tapioca, but I wasn't sure how long to cook them and they weren't as flavorful or as black as these pearls. I was also satisfied with the size of the bag since the WuFuYuan bags only come in 8.8 oz.

I do not think it is because of 'old stock', it is just how they are.  I am thinking of emailing Hershey and suggesting they very lightly spray the inside of the wrapper with food grade mineral oil so the candy does not stick."

Each pouch has roughly 12gms of carbohydrates (as per nutrition information the mfgr sent me) and is usually enough to do the trick for me without ""over-treating"".

Not Until my father had handed it to my hungry daughter one day.  It came out of no where so I had no idea why a grown man would have what I thought was baby food in his car.  You see he had got a sample in a food market one day so he had the sample handy in his car one day when his sugar levels dropped.  Being diabetic he needed something fast.  He liked the convenience of these so much he now keeps them handy all the time. My father is a boss to a lot of people and I worry that with the hours he must spend managing so many people, it is a struggle for him to balance ones blood sugar level right once work projects reach their 11th hour.  When he had first figured out he was diabetic, he would occational need to go to the ER because he could get it under control.  Usualy due to working too much combined with not eating enough.

Also, each squeeze has a fair amount of plastic packaging.  I know the applesauce cups do as well, but this just seems a bit wasteful to be carting around that much material for a 1/3 cup of applesauce.<br />Apart from the above, I love these pouches and so do my kids, and I'll most likely order them again."

I have been looking for these for a while. My kids love the flavor of these in their lunchbox, and I do too!<br />They taste fine with no extra junk in them."

It requires no refrigeration before opening, so it's great to take on trips or in the car in general.  My grandchildren can't get enough of it!"
2401,B002E0S4UW,A2VUNJQ13I4YR2,"Katie Bee ""Katie Bee""",5,"Tried these after getting frustrated with the similar product at Trader Joe's. My 3 year old can go through a 4 pack in a day if she is on an applesauce kick. These packs are a perfect size, the product is DELICIOUS and it is all natural - apples and apple juice are the only ingredients. It is a very smooth, almost creamy, sauce which is more appealing to my toddler who hates feeling little bits in things she eats and drinks. It can be sucked or squeezed from the pack, and we have found them to be awesome road trip snacks! I love the quantity that comes in one shipment - more is more with these! Everyone who sees us with them asks where we got them, and even my adult coworkers want to order them for themselves. Highly recommend this product!"
2402,B002E0S4UW,A3ON7K7B048QUG,BJ,5,"Great product for my little ones on the go.  Obviously a jar of applesauce is cheaper, but you are mostly paying for the convenience factor with a bonus that it has no added sugar.  Great to take along to the pool, in the car and we even took some to Disney world with us for a snack!  Cheaper on amazon with subscribe and save vs buying at the grocery store."

He's still too young to take pills or capsules, so I've been trekking around with those plastic tubs of applesauce. They're bulky and inconvenient, and they can't be reclosed, so it felt wasteful, too.<br /><br />These pouches are GREAT for day trips and for keeping in the diaper bag for emergencies. I can squeeze out just enough for a spoonful, put his medicine in it, and reclose the pouch for use a couple of hours later. I wish I'd discovered these months ago."

We have gone through about 50 of them and for the first time ever all the packages are empty.  There is nothing I hate more than wasting food and I am sure all parents of toddlers have thrown out literally a ton of uneaten food.  For some reason both my boys 2 & 4 always eat the entire serving of these.  Great product!
2408,B002E0S4UW,A2O7ORMAI9LSVW,Sarah,5,I have been giving these to my son since he was around 1 year old.  They are so convient and make for an easy non-messy (once he got the hang of it and learned not to squeeze too much)and healthy snack on the go.  These are truly not recommended for toddlers his age because of the the tiny lid which is a terrible choking hazard so obviously use the the utmost caution and never allow your toddler to have the cap!  These would be perfect with a larger cap like some other sqeezeables.

The applesauce is tasty - I think it's green apples, so it has a little green apple taste but not sour. Kids like it and like the squeezy action involved. The amount is great for a quick snack. It would be easy to use while walking/runny/biking as an alternative to the energy shot/gel things that some people like to use."
2413,B002E0S4UW,A2JI0RE8VKZ6AJ,Mazigra,5,The title is what I hear from my three year old son every morning. We love this applesauce. It is convenient and healthy so it has my approval every time that he asks for it. It is also cheaper in the case than in the store. I got it for $.60 per packet buying the case versus $.77 per packet at the large Superstore. Thanks Amazon!

Not only is Nature's Earthly Choice about FIVE times as expensive as buying in bulk (even from the high-end national chain store), but Nature's Earthly Choice is also more expensive than virtually all other brands. And after cooking, Nature's Earthly Choice Wheat Berries looked awful - as if they'd been totally overcooked and every kernal had exploded. (Perhaps that's because they've been turned into a ""cooks in 15 minutes"" processed grain.) Cooking instructions on the package are almost non-existant -- no mention of medium or low flame, covered or uncovered, whether all the water was all supposed to be absorbed or what. The salad recipe on the package made it sound like there should've been no excess water, so after 20 minutes on an uncovered simmer I figured I was supposed to drain the berries. I know I'll end up feeling like I should apologize to fans (of my usual apple salad with wheat berries) about how it looks.  Very disappointing and a ripoff."

This offering from Nana's definitely fits the bill.  I took off one star simply because it is pricey.  On the plus side, the cookies are quite big and it is nice to have an option for vegan treats.  I have tried to make gluten-free cookies of my own and have failed miserably because I try to make them healthy.

I discovered I have multiple food allergies and this is the only ""treat"" I have found that I am able to have.  I think these cookies are great.  Good texture, if a little dense (aren't all gluten free products?), with a nice lemon flavor.  The cookies are also big, so if you want to eat just one serving, which is half the cookie, it is satisfying.  I have also tried warming them up and dipping them in a bit of rice milk, yum!

Not ""wheat flour"", which is the same as white flour, and has no nutritional value.<br />Another plus is that even the chocolate chips in the cookie are sweetened with low-glycemic malted barley, not cane sugar.<br />I'm looking forward to trying more varieties of Nana's cookies."

I searched for another company that makes a similar cookie, and found this company (Nana's). The cookie is every bit as good as  the ABC's cookie, and a lot cheaper at that.

Do not buy these if you have Celiac disease -- that is, are gluten intolerant.<br /><br />Amazon should fix their search engine to NEVER display products that are not truly gluten free when people search for such. Even now, on the review form, Amazon is suggesting ""gluten free"" and ""celiac"" as tags for this product. That is flat out false."

There's hardly any lemon flavor to it and it sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. It was like trying to swallow paste. I tried a few more bites to give it a fair chance ... but wound up throwing the majority of the cookie in the trash.<br /><br />Unfortunately, i paid over $2 for this darn atrocity.

2494,B000FNB3AI,A3SGHTUG8I8YK2,"brilliant girls are beautiful ""Suzanne""",2,"Love these cookies. They taste wonderful. No trans fat, vegan, Kosher, healthy ingredients. So what's my gripe? If you look at the nutrition label on the back of the cookie package carefully, notice that a serving is 1/2 a cookie. And, 1/2 a cookie is 210 calories (different from the info on the Amazon site, but I'm looking at the package right now -- same product, current package). So, if you eat the whole cookie (I dare you to stop at 1/2. I know I can't! I tried.), you've eaten a 420-calorie cookie. Wow. That's a lot. Sorry to burst the bubble. I take one of these to work every once in awhile to eat for lunch (and 420 calories is a large lunch for me), but that's the only way I can eat them. I bought these not realizing they'd counted the cookie as two servings (which is pretty sneaky, IMO), and relied on the Amazon site info, which needs to be updated to reflect current package count. Great cookies, but if calories factor in for you, beware."

They are so, so, so good.  Whoever said that you need dairy and eggs in chocolate?  I have my omnivore friends and family try these cookies to show them that I am FAR from deprived!

2517,B000FNB3AI,A3MTRFKMYQNF7,"Eleanor Rose ""eleanor""",4,"These are very tasty cookies.  Originally I bought them because they are gentler on one's stomach.  After a few necessary surgeries last year I found that wheat products tended to make me feel bloated and uncomfortable if I ate too much of them.  Thus I tried to cut back on wheat.  Of course cookies are one of those things we feel guilty about anyhow.  Well I don't feel guilty eating these cookies!  They have no ingredients which cause an allergic reation such as refined sugars, dairly or wheat.  Also they are delicious.  My finace has been requesting them and he grew up on the all-american startch and potato diet!<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars:<br /><br />The only suggestion I have is that the packaging be improved.  By this I mean that each package has 2 servings but the serving is only half a cookie!  So one can gobble up too much at a time.  If they would make one-serving sizes that would be great.  It's easier to control calories, requires less mental calculation and is an honest way to report calories.  Also for children it's easier to say ""one"" cookie, then ""half"" a cookie.<br /><br />However I don't hold this too much against the company because this packaging is standard industry practise.  However I hope in future they will think about making a single-serving package or a same-size package that has 2 cookies.<br /><br />Otherwise they are fantastic for what they are meant to be...that is a cookie alternative for those of us with sensitive digestive systems, and perhaps a few loved ones with a sweet tooth."

It was so incredibly gritty that my tongue felt a little raw afterward. It was so crumbly that I couldn't even break pieces off of it to eat them... every time I tried to break a piece off, a big part of the cookie just fell apart.

They are free of gluten, dairy, eggs, soy and corn and even refined sugar, not something very easy to find.

To make up for the flavor, this one is loaded with chocolate--lots of chocolate chips along with cocoa powder in the cookie itself.<br /><br />They're tasty and filling; try one with a glass of cold milk nearby!"

Not too sweet, with a nice tangy flavor and no bitter or ""artificial"" taste.<br />It does have a granular texture from the brown rice flour, but that does not mean this is a dry cookie at all. It sort of melts in your mouth."

Take a chance on these cookies. I, for health reasons, started eating natural and organic foods. Treats like Nana's cookies fit nicely in to my diet. My favorite is Oatmeal, Raisin. The taste is amazing. I would recommend to anyone. Yum!"

They have no wheat and harmful sugar in them. I think they taste great. I don't need (or want) something with 8 tablespoons of sugar to taste good.

2543,B000FNB3AI,A1Y8IUMN7TBKS,Groovy Vegan,3,"I tend to love orange cranberry cookies, but this cookie recipe is not the best. It is excessively orange flavored, overwhelming the cranberry flavor. My guess is that they added too much orange flavor to the recipe. It also crunches, due to the second ingredient (puffed rice). I don't think the puffed rice crunch adds anything to the cookie. Furthermore, the cookie, although at a moderate level of sweetness, has a slight bitter aftertaste. It's not a bad cookie, but it's not particularly good either, and one I won't be buying again. IMO, it's not worth the 260 calories one gets from eating both halves.<br /><br />P.S. Only the first ingredient, the whole wheat flour is organic."

The Peanut Butter are always dryer than the others, but, unfortunately the last batch of Peanut Butter was way too dry.<br /><br />The Double Chocolate are always very moist and great tasting.<br /><br />I have tried most of the flavors, but Peanut Butter and Double Chocolate are my favorites.

I've eaten the chocolate chip, oatmeal-raisin and peanut butter ones - never the gluten-free, so can't comment on them.  I love that they've no refined sugar or hydrogenated fats like most other cookies.  I've been buying them locally, and my grocery store is frequently out of them, so I was delighted to find them on amazon for cheaper than at the store.  One reviewer commented on the calories.  HUH?  First of all, who on a diet buys then dings cookies?  Also, keep in mind that just one of Nana's cookies is nearly 1/4 pound (hello?).  If you were to eat 4-1/2 regular size cookies, you'd end up with the same number of calories but they wouldn't taste as good as Nana's or be as good for you.  But you can always save what you don't want for later.  Sometimes I'll just eat half a cookie and roll up the plastic bag and tape it so I can enjoy the second half later.  So far they've kept just fine for even a couple of weeks.  No worries."

I get to enjoy the sweet & chocolately taste I crave, without the sugar or chemicals in most other cookies. They are delicious and very satisfying. Because they are sweetened with fruit juice, my blood sugar does not get spiked, so I do not get a ""high"" followed by a crash after eating these cookies. Nor do I feel addicted to them, like I do when I eat products made with sugar. And, I like that they are gluten free, since we are bombarded by products made from wheat, and I crave a variety of grains, like oats and rice. I highly recommend these cookies - I eat them regularly and they fulfill my craving for sweets, which has been so helpful in making better food choices when I am faced with temptation. And on Amazon, they are priced very reasonably, and worth every penny."

Incredibly moist, luscious and yummy, these oversized cookies are as satisfying as they are good for you. With wholesome ingredients and no refined flour or sugar, these are truely healthy treats. Chocolate chips and coconut flakes are paired perfectly while the flavor of each is allowed to shine through. Brilliant!  If you love chocolate and coconut, especially together, in one chewy concoction, you would find these cookies addictive. And they are vegan too."

I have tried a few varieties of Nana's cookies, but her Chocolate Chip cookie is, without a doubt, the best tasting and the best textured of all.  I've been searching for a decent sugar-free cookie for many years and have tried just about every one, but none come even close to this one. It's delicious."

I want something nutritious which won't send me into a sugar frenzy, and I want it quick.<br /><br />If crunch is your thing, these are not for you. I prefer the softer cookie now......I'd rather not crack my teeth on a harder version.... If you're up and out in a hurry, this little delicacy will do the trick !!!"

While they are, to me, just ok right out of the package, they are delectable warmed up in the microwave for 30 seconds and eaten with ice cream on top! Preferably one that has some kind of chocolate in it to boost the chocolate flavor. A great alternative to sugar free products, which can cause stomach upset, for those of us that want to stay away from refined sugar! Just don't forget that these are not a low calorie food, read your labels carefully!"

I just love it and it doesnt bother my blood sugar at all. I would be hapier if it were wheat free but it is a true gem.  A cookie that taste fabulous and that you can feel good about eating. What's not to love. I appreciate the discount pricing from Amazon, its a big help as my husband and I go through boxes of them! And no we havent gained any weight and we feel great."

These cookies are soooooooooo good and truly have healthy ingredients. Some ""healthy"" cookies are hidden with potentially harmful sugars like evaporated cane juice which is just sugar albeit unrefined. Some can take it and some cant. As a hyploglycemic that needs that is very senseitve to sugar the ""good"" and the bad these cookies are such a healthy treat. I never feel sick after eating one even if I eat the entire cookie and I couldnt possibly be more satisfied if I ate a homemade cookie with unhealthy ingredients. These cookies all of them I have tried are delicious. The gluten free options are not quite as good but if you must stay away from gluten all together they are a great version. This is the ULTIMATE cookie!"
2559,B000FNB3AI,AL51MV9ZU9GVJ,scripley,5,"Interesting thing about reviews: you can tell as much about the reviewers as the items they're writing about.<br /><br />I've tried almost all of Nana's products and the No Gluten Ginger Cookie is my FAVORITE.  There's absolutely no guilt for me.  Brown rice and tapioca flour?  Fruit juice?  Canola oil?  What's not to like?  If, like me, you have to avoid dairy and sugar cane, it can be difficult to find a sweet treat that satisfies.  And if your girlfriend is gluten-free?  Well, now you're really in trouble.<br /><br />Fortunately, along comes Nana.<br /><br />This cookie has a great texture (almost like a scone: the real kind, from the UK) and a little kick.  It somehow maintains that perfect balance between spicy and sweet.  (See preamble, above.)  As with most of Nana's products, there's just one problem: I would be happier if the cookie were about as big as my head.  But that's why they come in boxes of twelve: one box lasts almost a week!<br /><br />Nana's other gluten free, dairy free, sugar free flavors - chocolate, lemon, and chocolate crunch - are all wonderful too, but this little wanton want-one is special.  Trust me.  Don't listen to the naysayers.  They just don't appreciate perfection; moist, buttery, spicy-sweetness.<br /><br />(See preamble, above.)<br /><br />Dear Nana: whatever that ""natural flavoring"" is, which hits the roof of my mouth like a monkey landing on my back, please don't take it out.  I pledge my everlasting devotion to your kitchen.  I'll even wash the dishes..."

Plumley ""Cookie Monster""",5,I was diagnosed with severe gluten and egg allergies roughly a year ago and had a hard time parting with my favorite kind of baked good: cookies. I never ate many in the first place but they were a treat or desert and I was thrilled to find a lemon cookie that satisfied my desire for baked goods.<br /><br />The consistency can be off-putting at first but the longer I go without wheat or gluten products the less important the consistency because I have almost forgotten what a real cookie tastes like. These lemon cookies are not tart but have a very nice lemony flavor that is reminiscent of a lemon bar. They are heavy and thick like a dense cake or brownie and incredibly chewy and fresh tasting.<br /><br />I would usually freeze these for a couple hours before taking one to school with me to have between classes. If you're able to drink soy or rice milk then a glass of vanilla or plain flavored milk will go great with these!
2565,B000FNB3AI,A3BFRGQLVNOO51,"M. Reich ""goatfrenzy""",5,These cookies are rich and chocolately. They can be dry. But a small priceto pay for a chocolate cookie that is gluten and sugar free.

Due to Celiac Disease and other gluten intolerances, three members out of our family of five must be gluten free.  These cookies sure fit the bill for a treat!  They are delicious, and even though they crumble a bit (if you eat gluten free you would probably be used to this since rice flour is commonly used, and it crumbles), they still have a soft moisture to them.  The ginger flavor is really good and not any spicier than a ginger snap.  My two boys ages 9 and 11 LOVE them.  When I pull the cookies out of the grocery bag, they dance around with joy!  The true test was when my husband tried one.  He does not have to eat gluten free, nor does he care to, lol.  He really liked it, and has since requested them when I shop! A+++ for these!!

My outlets are old and I had to use a short stub of an extension cord so the power supply could lie on the floor rather than hang from the wall.<br /><br />When illuminated, the tree is really lovely.  The light is fairly dim and it makes a perfect accent piece in a darkish room.  My sole concern at this point is how long the bulbs will last.  As the package insert notes, they are not replaceable.<br /><br />If you have a corner that needs an Asian accent, this could be it."
2597,B000H229EG,A219AMCC2ARB1C,Steve Wright,5,Tried some coconut coffee at my sons home and liked the light taste.  I ordered my first case and love it.  I have shared this with some coworkers and they love it too.  I'm hooked and am ordering my second case.
2598,B004NR0DJ4,A1TQZUSOU22E9M,Sidarta Tanu,5,"This Ghirardelli Mint Chocolate tastes really good. The chocolate isn't too sweet nor too bitter. It is also not too creamy or milky. As far as the mint filling, it adds some more sweetness to the Chocolate, but at the same time the mint is very refreshing. Perfect to have after dinner or as dessert.<br /><br />If you like Mint Chocolate, you might also want to try the After Eight Mint Chocolate. they are very good too. Also try the Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark Chocolate which is kind of interesting taste (a combination of chocolate/dark chocolate with white chocolate and peppermint crust)."
2599,B0088A60PS,A2PB84CRU4YZQ7,Victoria Benade,5,"This mix is really excellent, specifically for that summer blockbuster you've been dying to see!<br /><br />The mix has a very pleasing variety of textures and flavors, all of which work lovely together. It's fun to taste different components together to see what you get. My favorite are the M and M's and pretzels together (I'm a huge fan of Pretzel M and Ms and Flipz!), but, there are quite a few fun combinations. That's what keeps this mix lively and fun, just a variety is nice. This mix was also rich enough that the bag lasted me a long time while even being able to share it. This is a perfect mix, and I hope to see more varieties in the future!<br /><br />My advice is that you give the bag a good mix, even better if in a bowl, otherwise you end up eating all the pretzels and cookies before the m and ms and peanuts.<br /><br />The perfect summer/movie snack!"

2601,B000O3AOY0,AGTBEWGF0VHHA,Observant I,5,"**NOTE on 08/19/12:  This review was written for the SUGAR-FREE syrup; not sure why it's being linked to the product that contains SUGAR. I assume the flavor is similar, but when originally posted, this review showed up for the sugar-free version.**<br /><br />For those seeking sugar-free products without all of the chemical sweeteners like aspartame, this sugar-free Maple Praline Syrup from Blackberry Patch is a natural solution. A rich praline pecan flavor with hints of vanilla, this syrup is sweet and delicious without being cloying. The thick, slow pouring syrup offers a nice mouthfeel similar to that of ""regular"" pancake syrup, a nice switch from the watery, too-thin textures of some sugar-free products.<br /><br />A special bonus is the natural flavoring--no off tastes, no strange chemicals!<br /><br />It's important to note that the sweetener here is maltitol, a ""sugar alcohol"" that can, for some, create gastrointestinal discomfort in large amounts (20-30 grams/day). I don't have this experience (perhaps because I don't consume such large amounts), and I appreciate that maltitol is not carcinogenic... A little online research from credible sources may be useful if you're concerned about this issue.<br /><br />Blackberry Patch makes a number of delicious naturally-flavored sugar-free syrups; this one is my personal favorite. Experiment and find your own favorite!"

Pirate's Booty is a little crunchier and not greasy like regular junk food cheese puffs & the white cheddar is subtle, but very flavorful.

Personally, as mom, I think I'm a little addicted to them...but that's besides the point.  They are big bags of snacks - and what I liked is that each bag is actually LABELED as 1 serving - usually in bags this size (1oz doesn't SOUND like a lot - but it is) the manufacturers will say it's 1.5 or 2 servings and taking away a bag of snacks from a toddler isn't that easy.<br /><br />I bought these on sale and would do so again - on sale.  I'm not sure if my budget will be able to pay full price - but I would spend my gift cards on it."

I usually mix mine with a vanilla protein powder, my favorite being BSN Syntha 6, mostly because it's the best mixing powder I've found.

These noodles are strictly made from organic black beans and cook up wonderfully in about 6 minutes.  They are very filling and you don't need to eat much to appreciate them.  Each bag contains 4 servings and a serving is all you need. They are just barely a little bit heavier in texture than a ""normal"" noodle.  But, with the higher protein these contain and the health benefits of eating vegetarian or gluten free, they are a perfect substitute.<br /><br />As with most alternative noodle choices, you cannot cook up too much and store them in a sauce.  They will absorb the moisture and get mushy.  You can cook the entire bag, let them cool and then place them into individual baggies or containers to freeze for later.  They defrost well and maintain their flavor.<br /><br />For people afraid these will taste too much like beans, you don't have to worry; they do not.

The Organix organic dog food was a hit.  When they see the cans they stand up and take notice.<br /><br />When I opened the can, I could clearly see the difference in quality, and I could certainly smell the difference.  A can of Organix organic dog food is 95% organic, and made is the USA!<br /><br />A typical can contains 7.5% crude protein, 6% crude fat, 1% crude fiber, and 78% moisture.  The feeding recommendations are 3/4 to 1 1/4 per 15 lbs. body weight per day.  The dog food also contains several vitamins (Vitamin E, A, B12, & D3)and minerals.<br /><br />Several of the varities contain organic garlic and thiamine mononitrate which is a synthetic form of vitamin B1.<br /><br />I am so very pleased with this find.  After 4 years, and many bad purchases I've finally found the right food for Darby and Hampshire.  What an awesome dog food.  It really smells and looks like human grade food.<br /><br />I also purchased the Organix dry dog food but Hampshire and Darby both had a week of uncontrollable diareau, and Darby was also vomiting.  I returned the Organix dry food to the store, and they gave me a full refund.<br /><br />The Organix dry dog food made their feces very dark and running and the stains were more difficult than normal to remove.

It's thinner--like a creamy salad dressing.  So far, I've used it with deviled aggs, potatoes, potato salad, cold veggies, hot veggies, and its named use--on a salad.  Honestly?  It's amazing.  Many, many years ago, people made salad dressings like this for their ""lettuce salads"" (check out the ""I Love Lucy"" episode featuring Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing, and you will see what I mean).  It's a tangy, thinner variation on mayo . . . but it adds so much more flavor!  Simply magical.<br /><br />This leaves the often-used ranch dressing in the dust.  Give it a try!  I think you'll be happy you did!"

Richardson,5,"I ordered the 6 pack out of curiosity because I had ordered the HP Brown Sauce, and the Salad Cream was a recommended item.<br /><br />It arrived yesterday, and I've already used it 3 times! On a microwaved potato last night at dinner, on my poached eggs this morning, and in my ham & cheese lunch sandwich. My husband and I are already hooked on this stuff! He's already adding it to lots of foods. It's such a versatile sauce. Nice and creamy with that little bit of tang and a slightly eggy taste.<br /><br />I've already come back and subscribed to the auto delivery. I can see that between me, him and my mother ( who also likes it) we will be going through these bottles quickly."

Especially since it is lower in fat content than regualar mayonnaise and even low fat mayo made here in the USA.<br />Tastes terrific, with a little tang, is lighter than mayo and pours easily from the container. Certainly makes a healthier, tastier ,and refreshing alternative to regular mayo. Highly recommend this and will buy this again especially at this lower price offered by Amazon.

There's a hint of mustard and sugar and vinegar in it which gives it a great tangy taste that once you try it you just want more and more of it.

On my first trip in 1973 I had Heinz Salad Cream on a sandwich prepared by my aunt. I fell in love with the taste right away!<br /><br />It has a totally different taste from mayonnaise or salad dressing. It is wonderfully unique. I have tried it on salads and sandwiches and loved them both. I recommend this to anyone who likes mayonnaise or salad dressing and wants to try something different.<br /><br />Used to be, it was had to find anywhere in the USA. I used to bring back a dozen bottles each trip. Thanks to the Internet and better international selections in stores, it is easier to find.<br /><br />I agree that Heinz should market this product in the USA. It is sensational!"
2685,B001EQ5ACC,A15BHWG1L7SLF0,S. lippman,1,the only reason i gave salad cream 1 star is because of the price. i love miracle whip and this tastes exactly like kraft miracle whip. if you look at the label on miracle whip it is also called a dressing which i promise you heinz salad cream tastes just like miracle whip. so save yourself at least half the money that this product costs and just buy miracle whip.
2686,B004EKQM4U,A1RQQ2HWUGEUWA,EB MamaBear,4,"i bought these since my raw cacao powder that i usually buy from alive and aware was out of stock, i thought what the hey this is a GREAT price. but like another reviewer said, seems almost too good to be true.<br />although they are a little greyer in color than the picture which shows a richer dark brownish cacao nibs, they still tasted great.<br />in fact, i was really surprised by how delicious they are straight out of the bag. yes they are a tab bitter, as you would expect raw (unsweetened) cacao to be, but i was pleasantly surprised that they were totally edible this way, sort of like chomping on a roasted coffee bean but actually not that bitter even. my husband and i can nibble on a small palmful, plain, and like it that way.<br />but of course it is a little better with something sweet ;) i like it in a snack mix of raw cashews (naturally sweet and mild- a great compliment to cacao nibs) with large coconut flakes, and if i add some dried fruit it is REALLY heavenly!!<br />i am so glad i can eat my cacao without the usual sugar over load.<br />i even suggest brewing it like loose leaf tea in a strainer, and you can re-use the ""grounds"" a few times. sweeten if you like, maybe add a little good raw cream, and it is better than coffee and better for you to boot!<br />i am a total cacao-holic now.  5 lbs is NOT too much, so go for it!! we use over a pound a month between mostly my husband and i ( okay we give some to our two small children, just not too much!). i also LOVE to share this great blessing from Mother nature :)<br />i hesitated to give this the full 5 stars, because like i said, i think the color indicated slightly less than the freshest quality . but it is a high 4 stars, and i still totally recommend it, especially at this price.<br /><br />you will LOVE it!! peace be with you!"
2687,B004EKQM4U,AQM74O8Z4FMS0,Sunshine,5,"Taste: These nibs taste a bit bitter just as they should because they contain no sugar and are raw unprocessed cacao. Cacao is considered a super food because of all the vast array and quantity of nutrients they contain and this is exactly the way to eat them to get the maximum benefit. My husband can eat them straight out of the bag but if you need a little sugar with your cacao like I do you could try this: I melt some dark chocolate, stir in about equal amount of cacao nibs and place teaspoonfuls onto a nonstick surface. Place in frig and when hardened, put them in a container and stash in the frig. The taste is really good, some lightly sweetened melt-in-your-mouth chocolate with crunchy cacao nibs for a great texture contrast. You could also add them to a shake if you have a really good quality blender. You could also do a search for recipes on the internet and you'll find all kinds of ideas.<br /><br />Quantity: Just right, enough to make it worth the free shipping but not too much that you can't consume it before it looses it's freshness. My husband and I can easily go through a lb or more a month.<br /><br />Quality: Excellent, they look and taste just like the nibs I purchased from whole foods a few months ago.<br /><br />Price: Excellent, only a fraction of the price you'll pay at a grocery store or other online sources.<br /><br />Shipping: Prompt, well packaged."
2688,B004EKQM4U,A3S8BDPVGJNH9C,Dan Tompkins,1,"If you've ever had raw cacao nibs, you should realize immediately that these nibs are roasted.  I contacted the seller about this, and here is what I said, and how they responded:<br /><br />Me:<br />Hi.  I received 5 lbs. of Cacao nibs yesterday, but they are not raw like I ordered.  These distinctively smell and taste like roasted nibs.  After I noticed this, I looked at the bag.  The label says that it is Organic, but doesn't mention being raw (Organic, Herbal Essence Cacao Nibs).  Do you want to send me some raw nibs or give me a refund?<br />Thanks,<br />Dan<br /><br />Them:<br />Raw Nibs are so bitter if not roasted, All cacao nibs have to be roasted at low temperature.<br />All our customers love them, try it, if you chose not to use it, fine please return the 5 lbs bag for a refund.<br />thank you<br />imed<br /><br />So, they've decided that since raw nibs don't taste as good, they're going to roast them.  (Why not throw in some cream and sugar while you're at it?  They taste really good like that!).  It's fine if you want to roast them, just don't market them as raw!<br />But, I decided to give them the benifit of the doubt.  Maybe they ""roast"" their cacao at a low enough temperature to still be considered raw.  I emailed them back:<br /><br />Me:<br />At what temperature do you roast your cacao?<br /><br />Them:<br /> below 80 degrees.<br /><br />Below 80 degrees?  That's gotta be celsius right?  A quick conversion tells me they roast their supposedly raw cacao at 175 degrees.  That's not raw by any standard.<br />I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt one more time.  They did say that ""all cacao nibs have to be roasted...""  So I emailed Navitas Naturals about their raw cacao nibs (I was eating Navitas nibs before trying these).  Navitas processes their cacao below 118 degrees, making their cacao truly raw.  Halaleveryday is clearly a shady company who should not be trusted.  Yes, these nibs taste better than raw nibs, but you're not buying raw cacao for the taste.  I advise staying away from Halaleveryday, Alive and Aware, and Herbal Essence products.<br /><br />How are these roasted nibs?  They taste much more like chocolate than raw cacao does, and are much crispier and easier to chew.  There are definitely some hard pieces (pieces of shell, I assume?), so watch out for your teeth if you decide you can trust this company enough to eat their products."
2689,B004EKQM4U,A300N4AS17NZFG,Straight On,1,"I originally gave these five stars, but I just learned that they're NOT actually raw. My original review is below; now they get only one star for false advertising. Stick with Navitas Naturals Cacao Nibs.<br />--------------------------<br /><br />Much cheaper than Navitas Naturals Cacao Nibs and just as good. These might be an acquired taste, but once you ""get it"" you'll love them."

2692,B004EKQM4U,A2OR8QYLG9WZ5M,"Jennifer Cote ""chef and author""",5,"I was apprehensive about investing in a whole five pounds, as I wasn't sure of the quality. (A few mentions of ""grey"" color, etc.) But the price was so right! I had been getting a quality product from Wilderness Family Naturals, but it was considerably pricier. PLUS shipping. So I went for it- ordered the 5 lb. ""Alive and Aware Organic Raw Cacao Nibs"" off of Amazon.<br />As a cacao nib connoisseur, I can say these are perfect. Read up, if you've never ordered nibs before, because these won't be just like eating a candy bar only healthier. No, nibs are unique. They are going to be a tad bitter, and yes, maybe the crunch is a bit unlovely for some.<br />But for cacao-nib-lovers, these are every bit as good and fresh and tasty (and rightfully colored) as any I've ever gotten. Only difference: All the rest have cost a lot more.<br />Go for it, I say! Order these! Keep the extra in the fridge (I suppose you could even freeze 'em), and they'll keep months. Yum..."

2698,B004EKQM4U,A3A2T8RSSVIOQS,Erin Braun,5,"These are a fantastic product. I first bought them because they were cheaper than Nativas, but I prefer them.  The pieces are larger which is better for me because I snack on them.  I don't use them for cooking or smoothies.  I love the taste and texture.  I seriously can't stop eating them. If you're thinking they'll taste just like dark chocolate you'll probably be disappointed.  It's very apparent they're the source of chocolate, but they're definitely more bitter than even a very dark chocolate.  My only concern is that I eat a lot of them and they're loaded with saturated fat.  1 ounce has 35% of your daily value of fat and 130 calories.  I went through a 5lb bag in 3 weeks.  I'm afraid to do the math.  I just ordered another bag but I'm definitely going to slow down on them. - I just did the math and I hope I'm wrong - that's almost 4 oz. a day.  140% of my daily saturated fat and 520 calories.  Yikes!"

2700,B004EKQM4U,AW7T5OK0X4OEA,22201guy,2,"When I received the item, the part of the label with the weight had been torn off which made me suspicious.  I weighed the item on my electronic kitchen scale and the weight including the plastic bag was 4 pounds 14 ounces instead of 5 pounds of nibs as advertised.  I later transferred the nibs to another container and weighed the empty plastic bag; it was .95 ounces so I was shortchanged almost 3 ounces of nibs."

These cacao nibs also contain a lot of hard shells .  Also, I could tell by the taste that they were roasted.  The whole reason I bought them was because they claimed to be organic and raw.  With all this deception, now I'm wondering if they're even organic.  They do taste pretty good, though not as good as the truly raw nibs I bought before because the roasting imparts a slightly charred flavor."

I did not particularly like the flavor, and did not find any large amount of chicken.  It is mainly large thick noodles with a few peas and pieces of carrot.  it is listed as having 15 grams of protein, but has little of anythiing else except for salt.  It indicates 990 mg of salt.  I did finish eating it, but will not buy it again.  There are better products on the market from other companies.  See products by Dinty Moore and Healthy Choice reviewed separately."
2705,B001E50UBE,A2M9D9BDHONV3Y,A. Bennett,1,"I decided to try multiple Hormel products when the sale made their price reasonable but I found many of the products to be just HORRIBLE!  This particular Chicken and Noodle is a bowl of salt with hard, thick noodles and a few little pieces of chicken.  They do give lots of sauce though!  I love sauce but ended up spitting out the noodles because they were just awful.  And though I love salt....this product was mostly salt.  I ended up giving all but the one I tried to eat to the local food bank.  I do feel guilty about that but I am sure someone might like this product.  I will never buy this product again and I do not recommend it to anyone.  Buy it at your own risk!!"
2706,B001E50UBE,ANLQGQLRKRZ6W,"SSKathleen ""Kathy""",4,"I have purchased several of the Hormel Compleats and some of them are just plain nasty tasting. However, the chicken & noodles is my favorite for flavor, especially the sauce. I like the consistency of the noodles, the convenience of the product and love the fact that I can have these on hand in my pantry and they don't require refrigeration for storage.<br /><br />The only negative about the product - and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars - is the fact that I have problems peeling back the covering after heating. I am a senior citizen with limited strength in my fingers. The product requires brute strength to peel back the covering and I have to resort to scissors every time. The scissors or knife get messy and sometimes I end up with part of the chicken & noodles all over my countertop."
2707,B001E50UBE,A2RL1RS6PWUHWI,Jennifer Ackerman,4,"The chicken and noodle is definitely one of the better meals in the Hormel line. It is a little bit salty but no where near the saltiness many of the red meat meals have. The noodles are nice and thick (a previous reviewer described them as hard but mine were exactly as they should be even with the extra thickness) and the chicken is fairly substantial. If this were less calories and way less sodium, I think I like it enough where I might actually have this once in a while for a really quick lunch. But unfortunately 1400mg of sodium is way more than what I'm looking for in a lunch. Even still though, this is a pretty tasty one for Hormel.<br /><br />For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty good. It will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost, but if you are going to compare it to something you can make yourself, well, there really isn't any comparison."

This one is especially good, and I shall be ordering it on a regular basis.  There is one problem, however, and it is common to all the Compleats: there is entirely too much sodium in them.  I am having a time with my feet swelling.  It is a real shame when you consider how difficult it is for us seniors to have to re-adjust our ways of doing the simplest of things.  We should be able to depend upon time-tested brands like Hormel and Campbell's to supply us with reliable products."

These contain 24 individually packaged (8 each) 2oz sized servings of Roasted & Salted Cashews, Dry Roasted & Salted Almonds, and Roasted & Salted Peanuts.<br /><br />The 2oz is perfect of an afternoon snack or take along on a car trip. The nuts were fresh tasting and not over salted.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
2713,B0015OMKVM,A3C56IXBT4ETXA,Bashert,2,"The thing is they taste stale to me all of the varieties that came in the box. It was not a seller issue because the expiration dates aren't until April & March of 2013, but nonetheless.  Kirkland usually has great products, but won't be purchasing them again.  We'll find another alternative.  They are salty, not as bad as most pre-packaged nuts. Wish they could just roast and barely drop some salt in, but alas the answer is to put the work in and shell my own."
2714,B0015OMKVM,A315W8Y4H7S8HW,MamaLisa,2,"I bought these as part of my husband's Father's Day gift and wrapped them without scrutinizing them carefully.  When he opened them today, we found that they were already past the ""best by"" date of April 21, 2012.  He told me he'll eat them anyway or I would have requested a replacement.  Seller shouldn't be shipping product which is past its ""best by"" date.  Additional feedback posted 6/18/12: Wow! I didn't even contact amazon customer service--all I did was post this review.  When I opened my email this morning there was a notification from amazon that they had refunded the full purchase price on these nuts.  That's what I call proactive customer service!  With service like that I can order new products with confidence, and will do so again!!!"

The problem is that they always occur in huge-sized bags or jars. Well, the last time I was there I spotted a 48 oz (3 pounds) box of Kirkland Signature Variety Snacking Nuts packaged as peanuts, almonds and cashews in 24 individual 2.0-oz bags. Perfect. I use individual bags for my lunch, for a snack, for taking along hiking or camping or for giving to my little boy (3.5 years old). Just right! The bags could be opened as needed and need no turn the whole batch stale. Besides, these are three of my favorite nuts. Good Taste. Good nutrition. Not too salty. Just right.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

We just found out our son is gluten intolerant, this is one of the few foods from 'before' he gets to keep eating.  Great for on the go or school lunches, they help him not feel so left out as all the other kids gobble down their gluten-containing granola bars."

I looked them up on Amazon and was excited to see that I could essentially get a box or two free by buying a case versus the individual boxes.  The problem is that many of the boxes had bars that were not the same consistancy as my son was used to and they just fell apart or had what he called syrup on them.  I am not sure if they were stored differently which caused issues or what but I was very disappointed.  I know my son threw numerous bars away when he had been begging to eat them up to this point.  I am hoping I just got a bad case but I am not sure whether to order again.  Before this experience I would have given the product 4 or 5 stars.  Based on this case maybe a 2 so I averaged it.

He used to love them and I also noticed the bar is more compact now and texture is different.  I still think they are good but unfortunately I will have to take them off my auto delivery service since they were purchased for my son.  The Bars were already delicious I just wish they wouldn't have changed them.  But I do recommend these they are delicious."
2722,B000E4ALGU,A2DOMNKGJRGRPU,mtsmith66,5,I have a son with multiple food allergies so I was very excited to find this product.  Both of my children (the other has no allergies) love the taste and it's much healthier than most granola bars available.
2723,B000E4ALGU,A33FY8TZXEPSXV,nathalie martin,5,I tried these bars because they are gluten free and one of my sons has a gluten allergy. They are so good now both of my sons constantly want one and sometimes fight over them. Its a nice sweet snack for my allergy prone son.Only downside is the cost. But anything for the kids.

She is on a gluten-free diet, so her food choices are pretty limited. It's nice to find somethig she REALLY likes."

I am a big fan of EnviroKids products, including the Crispy Rice Berry Bars. They are soft and chewy, with little bits of fruit. My kids eat these up and I feel okay with them eating these on an almost daily basis because they have so many natural ingredients. The only drawback is that they can get messy-- my two-year-old especially tends to hold on to them too long and the rice cereal starts to come apart and get stuck in the carpet, clothes, etc. Still a great gluten free product!"

It's great tasting and her parents and I feel confident that she is eating something healthy (it's USDA Organic certified).  Being fully organic and with minimal sugar its a great treat.  No need to worry abou the high fructose other other unhealthy additives when eating them!
2729,B000E4ALGU,A2SZWFJX0783BF,Willow,4,"These are very tasty bars.  They have enough dried berries to taste, and I usually get at least one with every bite.  It is a sweet bar, kind of like a Rice Krispie Treat, but not quite as sticky.  They're soft and stay fresh for a long time, too.<br /><br />I love the organic ingredients, always feel good about eating foods without synthetic pesticides or other crap like that.<br /><br />These bars don't have high fructose corn syrup, thank goodness, so right there tells you they're worth the cost.  They do contain invert cane juice, which is 1/2 fructose, so if you have a fructose intolerance, use caution because of that ingredient.<br /><br />I highly recommend these, especially for those on a gluten-free diet."

They are a great, healthy alternative to other breakfast bars and do not contain high fructose corn syrup or the other junk they put in other products.

Chocolate & peanut butter flavors are great as well.  I typically buy these in bulk from Amazon; the price is comparable to what local retail stores are selling it for (i.e. Wegmans, Whole Foods, etc.)."

Can't wait to try the other flavors as well."

She had to go gluten-free last year and this was the first treat we found that she really liked.  She takes them to school for her snack and doesn't care that the other kids are getting things like animal or graham crackers.  I like them because they are healthy and portable.  I keep one in the car and one in my purse for emergencies.

We take them with us when we go hiking for a quick snack (he prefers the peanut butter). Also, they are only 2 points on Weight Watchers so they fit in our diets and I prefer them to treats with artifical sweetners and loads of chemicals. I try to stick with organic as much as possible so appreciate that aspect, too. They don't have much fiber, but I consider them a treat so it's ok. For more fiber, I recommend LaraBars and ReBars. They are both excellent products, but not as much of a ""sweet treat"" as Envirokidz bars."

In the local grocery store, they are SOOO expensive, about $5 per box ---- so this is a STEAL! I'm stocking up because I hate to be without a ""Tiger Bar"" during a long commute from work with my son.... I feel better knowing that they're so good for him, or at least, they're not bad like most snacks are. It's nice to have something in my purse or in the car when he needs a snack. They're the best!"

They are individually packaged, which makes them great for when we are on the go."

I was so happy when I found this because it was affordable and (I thought) he could actually eat it.  When it came I was really upset to find that it's made with soy, not canola like it states.

2752,B000E4ALGU,A1SH76OGRIHLOP,T. Bednarick,1,We've tried these bars several times in a few different flavors and they are always cross contaminated with dairy.  I think the chocolate actually contains milk so that may be the source of the problem. My kid's allergic so it's pretty easy to tell when a new food is causing a problem.<br /><br />They're delicious and the times we've tried them they are never stale or too hard to chew (like the other natural crispy rice bar that is actually dairy free).  Wish they didn't have a cross contamination problem.
2753,B000E4ALGU,A2Y8S904GD2IBJ,ALP,2,"These taste good, but are a bit too sweet.  The sweetness level reminds me of Rice Krispie treats.  Keep in mind they have 7 g of sugar and just 1 g of protein.  There really isn't much nutrition in these bars... 110 virtually empty calories."

I saw this for about $5 for the five pack and since the price was comparable to the Velveeta version (which is far from ""all natural"") I bought it.<br />Stirring the cheese sauce into the leftover water from cooking the macaroni took a few minutes. I did not time it, but it was more than two minutes. My son would not eat it. I made myself a package. It tastes kind of like macaroni with Cheetos powder on it (although I think Cheetos powder would taste better). I wound up melting a piece of organic American Cheese on it and stirring that in to make it palatable.<br />I think I'm going to try to figure out how to microwave a small amount of regular macaroni then melt cheese on it in the microwave to make my own macaroni and cheese.<br />This product was a big fail in my household.<br />This is the first Annie's product that I have tried that I did not like.

Also, it says to use 1/2 cup of water, and it really needs about 1 cup if you even want half a chance of stirring the powdered cheese into the noodles, it is way too dry without more water.

I was in quite a hurry, but I was starving, and the rest, as they say, is history! It's a very good breakfast on the run, and its great for kids, as well.

The kids have been eating it, but they say that there is a slightly weird aftertaste.  When prepared following the directions, the noodles sometimes aren't quite cooked, and the water ratio isn't quite right --- sometimes ending up with inadequate water to make the sauce. Perhaps that's my microwave, but I haven't noticed this problem with other foods.  The powder sauce packet doesn't mix well even with the hot bits of water, leaving clumps.  The pluses --- quick to make, kids will eat it (sometimes), portions are small -- perfect for a preschooler, requires no milk or added oil.  We are satisfied for the amount we paid, but not likely to purchase again, unless there is a promotion or sale."

I would advise everyone to throw their lives away and click the ""buy this product"" for Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) immediatly, if not sooner.<br /><br />While they are at it they should go and buy Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz and also Amish Style Roll Butter to compliment your Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6), with Ener-G Foods Papa's Loaf, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6) (for your Amish Style Roll Butter, of course.)<br /><br />I can personally say that this is easy to make, first you place your Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) into a thing of boiling water.  Then you grab your Ener-G Foods Papa's Loaf, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6), then grab your Amish Style Roll Butter and spread on about 8 ounces of this bad boy.  Then grab a cup and pour in some Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, for delicious whole milk flavor of course.<br /><br />I also can personally say that Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6), saved my family.

The first part and last part of the bite is good; somewhere around the middle to end you get a funny taste.  No bad aftertaste though.

They're also a good size, so I'll probably toss one into my bag for a snack on occasion also.

What a pity.  Tastes like it, too.<br /><br />To me (and hubby) this coffee tastes like it was sprayed with a bad, dollar store perfume.  There is a slight mocha flavor, but it is so fake tasting that it's rather gross.  Adding a little milk helps make it more palatable, but I wouldn't call it tasty.<br /><br />The only good thing about the Mocha Eight O'Clock Coffee is when it is brewing, the whole kitchen smells like a gourmet coffee shop.  So, I guess it's a good room potpourri...<br /><br />I don't recommend it simply because of the usage of artificial flavors that TASTE artificial.  Other varieties without such artificial-ness are better.  The coffee brand itself isn't bad, but this Mocha flavor is."

They taste better than all the other pitted olives I have bought in the past except they have a little bit softer texture.  The resealable pouch is a nice plus.  It seals good and they stay fresh and soft without drying out at all.  So far the only complaint that I have is that I can't stop eating them once I open up one of the packs.  :-)
2874,B005EX6MUU,A1RRMZKOMZ2M7J,"Sue Katz ""Honey Bee""",1,"The taste of these olives is OK. They taste like Greek olives and are a bit soft. Unfortunately, I think they are far too greasy & oily. The oil does not taste like a high quality olive oil. Moreover, the first package had a large number of pits fragments that were small enough not to be seen but large enough to damage teeth and dental work. Overall, 2 stars for my first bagged serving.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my experience with these olives took a turn for the worse. Upon opening the second bag, I noticed that there was white residue and spots all over the olives - a picture is posted. I'm guessing it's mold. It could be due to a package that was never fully or properly sealed, or it could be due to the manner in which Amazon stored them, or perhaps a combination of the two. Regardless, it's simply unacceptable to open a food product and find it in this condition. I would give it 0 stars now if I could.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, I don't recommend this product. I previously tried the green olives from this brand, which were great, but I won't be repurchasing anything from the the Cat Cora by Gaea brand again because of this experience - that includes previous purchases of olive oils, green olives and tapenades. Moreover, this is the second time I've received moldy, white-spotted olives from Amazon. The last time it was the Byzantine brand, and I hoped switching brands would rectify the problem. Unfortunately it didn't, so this is also my last olive purchase from Amazon."

I'm sure it'll come down eventually.<br /><br />I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now.  As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend.  Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill.  I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1.  The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor.  2.  I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place.<br /><br />There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago.  It is THE perfect medium blend.  There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers.  It's bright, but not too bright.<br /><br />Does the K-cup version do it justice?  Yes.  Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup.

I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.<br /><br />The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a ""Bold"" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special.

I was so elated when I found out that Starbucks was now going to be in Keurig form, let alone this flavor.  I normally can not stand coffee with cream and sugar.  I enjoy my coffees, black, no cream or sugar, and STRONG.  This one is the lone exception.  Starbucks claims this is a medium roast.  Take it with a grain of salt.  It has a fantastic aroma but a bitter taste, with also a bit of an aftertaste.  The first time I had this at a Starbucks, I wanted to throw this out.  To be honest, it was nasty, but with the price of a Starbucks coffee, at their coffee shop, I refused to give in.  I added (2) packets of sugar, along with some half & half, and ""Oh my God"", I was in heaven.  I should say, this is for an 8oz cup.  Not only is this so good, it's actually my favorite coffee.<br /><br />Now with the K-Cup version... to make the equivalent, I select an 8oz brew, use half & half to where it's a medium brown, and (2) packets of Splenda.  Splenda, in coffee tastes as good as sugar.  I'm diabetic.  This tastes as good as if it was from their coffee shop.<br />Since this can get expensive if your going to have more than (2) cups a day, I've decided to purchase this in 1lb bags and use the ""ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"", to make this more cost effective.<br /><br />The bottom line is I think if you, like me, don't like this coffee, by itself, try it with cream and sugar.  You'll be surprised at the difference in taste.<br /><br />By the way... why this says I'm in New Caledonia, I have no idea nor can I get it to change.  I'm from NJ."

I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.<br /><br />The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a ""Bold"" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special. To my tastes, there are plenty of better k-cups for less money. Not worth the extra cost and a little on the weak side. I'm giving it three stars, but 2.5 stars would be about right."

There was no packaging inside the box to hold the k-cups in place and protect them, they were just laying in the box loosely.  Some of the cups in the box were also damaged, probably due to the lack of packaging in the box.  This is not the quality anyone would expect from companies such as Keurig and Starbucks!  I suspect the box has been opened previously.  I do not know what happened on the sellers end, but what they sent out was not an original new package of keurig k-cups!  The cups seem to be authentic, but it is hard to tell since the packaging was not up to par and even though the box was sealed, it is looks like the box has been opened previously.

I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances.<br />When I returned back in this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />* Pike Place + Colombian + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.<br />  The Colombian was the Best of the lot.<br /><br />Read my comments, after each bullet item:<br /><br />  * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about<br />  2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig ""Brew"" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!"

It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff. Now, my dog spits out the all-natural kibble -which I assume he thinks tastes like cardboard after having his taste buds desensitized by all the salt.

This just adds a nice portability to fresh dog food and I do mean it came fresh. I have bought this same brand at the store before and it was not fresh plus I paidd a higher price per can.

He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )<br />So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.<br />So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!<br />Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.<br />( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )"

I checked cans at a pet store and pediagree had more vitamins and more crude protien then science diet n others. I know the food is made bad but it isnt effecting your dog. I recieved the cans unharmed just 1 was a lil bent but it wasnt a biggy n i recieved it fairly quick and my dog loves the food. I recommend this food for low income pet owners.  N pedigree may be bad but feeding your dog people food is even worse. Think about that!.

None of the humans in the family have tried it though.<br /><br />It has all the meat in it that a dog needs for maintenance, and it can be mixed with dry food for extra crunch.  There is the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones, according to the Pedigree people.

The point is how does it compare to other cubes and powders of broth, and its the BEST!!<br />  Barry Farms Beef Broth Powder has rescued many a pot of rather weak tasting soup and elevated its apparent quality to the point of rave reviews from my family!!"

Just off the top of my head, the way it compliments sweet potatoes is amazing. Seriously, if you have a microwave and a little butter or margarine, you can have an awesome side dish in about five minutes. Or use it on sweet potato fries, or sweet potato...<br /><br />Okay, it's good for much more than that. I use it as a substitute for brown sugar whenever I'm working with a recipe that uses small amounts (teaspoon / tablespoon or two) like stew, sauces, and to caramelize some things I cook on the grill. Without exception, Sweetie Blend adds an interesting dynamic that always goes over well.<br /><br />And yeah, it's pretty great with coffee and Cheerios.<br /><br />I was totally geeked to see Amazon carried this, and the price is unbeatable. The regular price is a few dollars less than buying direct from Chef Paul's site, but the Subscribe & Save price is nearly half-off when you consider shipping.<br /><br />""But what am I going to do with six of these if I don't like them?"" Give them to friends? Take them to work? Make a Chef Paul gift basket?

The nutty flavor is so good and really strong, it permeates the whole cup and you'd swear there were ground up Macadamia nuts in this latte! It's rich, creamy, and just divine. The flavoring is spot-on, super natural tasting and not at all artificial. One of their best!"
2970,B0093A5RU6,A29P51TN9KKMU9,Azzrian,5,"Well I have to admit I was not as excited to try Macadamia Nut Matcha as I had been other flavors. A nut matcha to me seemed to be something one would mix with another outstanding sounding flavor, such as white chocolate mixed with macadamia nut perhaps. Alas white chocolate has not been released yet. I am sure I could have found something else to mix with this flavor but since it is my first time having it and I wanted to do a review I had it on its own.<br /><br />I can only say WOW just simply WOW. This is the most amazing macadamia nut taste! It is such a strong flavor!<br /><br />All I can say is once again I am absolutely not disappointed in Red Leaf's quality and flavors. I was so worried this flavor would only be so-so, a little nutty but not really having any true flavor unto itself. Fact is this tastes more macadamia nutty than anything else I can remember having outside of macadamia nuts themselves straight out of a can or jar, and I rarely have the nuts that way. Usually when I have macadamia nuts they are in a cookie somewhere.<br /><br />Let me just say this, if I had to choose between a couple of the cookies, and this matcha - I would pick the matcha hands down every time! And know that while I say that White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies are may all time favorite cookies!<br /><br />As always RLT's base matcha is superior to any other I have had."

The Duds arrived completely melted in a solid mass at the end of each of the product boxes. The BLOB of Duds in each box were so badly melted that they adhered to the cardboard inside the boxes. The end that could be seen showed that the solid blob of Duds had turned white from melting. I called the seller and they actually recommended NOT buying their Duds until DECEMBER when it cools down in Arizona. WHY THE HECK DON'T THEY JUST PACKAGE THEM AS PERISHABLES SO THEY'LL ARRIVE UNMELTED IN THE FIRST PLACE!?! I receive perishables from sellers across the country without problems all the time. I've never seen anything like this - it's really UNBELIEVABLE! They also want the product back before issuing a refund. So, they're sending a prepaid RMA to me. They could've saved themselves the return shipping AND a customer if they'd just correctly packaged the product in the first place!!! Obviously, I do NOT recommend buying from this third-party seller (even in December!). Clearly, they do not even approach Amazon's high shipping standards and customer service."

So why only 4 stars then?  Well although the candy is easily a 5 star candy it can have DISASTROUS effects on anyone who has dental work like fillings or caps.  I have literally been brought to my knees in pain by this candy!  There is nothing worse than enjoying a Milk Dud, when all of a sudden... sharp pain and the sudden taste of chocolate dental cement exploding in your mouth!

I can't find these any more in store so I'm contemplating buying them here; the price is about $1.50 less per box than I've seen at Kroger or Whole Foods, so this really is a great deal.<br /><br />It's true that the texture with these is different than with regular Haribo-type gummies; they don't have the same chewiness. But I prefer their flavor by a mile, and they don't make my teeth feel weird like the other kinds do (it's hard to explain but the regular kinds leave a strange texture on your teeth, and you can almost hear cavities being chipped away into your molars as you chew). My only gripes are that sometimes an individual pouch will have somewhat dried out candy in it, and there are occasional hard spots in some of the candy. But I'm giving these five stars anyway. They're awfully good, pleasantly habit forming, and relatively healthy (no artificial sugars or coloring in the least), so if you're going to be having candy one way or the other, this is a nice choice."

I have eaten other brands of Gummi Bears (or Gummi Bear wannabes), and these did not taste anything like those.  The flavors were not very distinct or fruity.  The texture was also very different and not very palatable.  I know that these are vegan Gummi Bears and do not contain gelatin, and I assume that is why the texture is so different.  However, I have eaten another brand (Sunny Bears) of gelatin-free ""Gummi Bears"", and their texture was very different, more like jelly candy.

They arrived yesterday, and I immediately ripped open a bag.<br /><br />They're good, but the texture isn't quite the same as gummi bears with animal-based gelatin. Something about he chewiness isn't quite right. You could easily slice these with the dull side of a knife. A regular gummi, on the other hand, would require a few strokes with a serrated blade. The consistency, however, is very good; they're not too hard or too soft. And the flavors were even better than many brands of regular gummi bears.<br /><br />Overall, they're definitely the best vegetarian alternative to traditional gummi candies that I've found. They're much better than the ones from the bulk bin at Whole Foods."

They are perfect when you don't have time to eat something more substantial to get quick energy. The price at which Amazon offers them is affordable compared to what my local supermarket charges. These strawberry flavored bars are low in fat and cholesterol, too--a great plus! Moreover, they are even ""certified kosher"" if that matters to you. Moreover, these bars are both chewy and satisfying  SMILE<br /><br />However, this cereal bar is not perfect. Each bar contains 26 grams of carbohydrates and 13 grams of sugar; sugar can sometimes turn into fat in your body. These amounts of carbohydrates and sugar are a lot for a comparatively small cereal bar! Moreover, this food bar is not for anyone on a salt free diet as it contains some salt; and people with allergies to wheat or milk should consult their doctor before they eat this food.<br /><br />These bars go down better if you eat them with juice, milk or water. I eat them with water or apple juice myself.<br /><br />Overall, the strawberry flavored Nutri Grain cereal bars are useful for those of us who are not allergic to any of their ingredients and who want a healthy alternative to a regular breakfast or a candy bar. The Amazon price makes them affordable and I also recommend them as a nutritious snack food that is especially good for people on the run. They are far superior to any candy bar!"

Sometimes he'll eat almost anything we put in front of him and sometimes he'll eat almost nothing. It's these latter episodes that bother me, so I try to have some snack foods around just to be sure that he gets enough. Take chocolate milk, for example. I can almost always get a glass in him and it's good nutrition. Another item is whole-grain fruit bars. I shop at Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Markets and usually buy their store brand. They're whole grain and organic and taste rather  good. If I give one to the boy it will almost always disappear in short order. Well, the last time I was there they had a small display of Kellogg's Nutri-grain Cereal Bars on half-price sale. I should have known better than to pick up a box of eight of the strawberry variety. I had one and it tasted fine, although I don't think it was as good as the store brand. My son wouldn't eat it. He just took one bite and that was it.

By using the word ""Nutri"" as part of the name of the product, consumers are tricked into thinking these are healthy. These should really be called CANDY-GRAIN bars! Here's the nutritional low down:<br />1. These bars contain 13 grams of sugar. (Notice the first ingredient in the ""filling"" is strawberry preserves, made of high fructose corn syrup and strawberries. The next ingredient is...corn syrup, followed by fructose, which is also a sweetener.) More sweeteners appear on down the ingredients list. Out of the 140 calories in this tiny bar, 62 calories come from sugar.<br /><br />2. These bars have partially hydrogenated oil in them. That's the type of oil that contains artery clogging trans fat. Yuck.<br /><br />3. They contain less than 1 gram of fiber. That means that the bars include very, very little whole grain or fruit, either of which would increase fiber content.<br /><br />4. They do contain some vitamins. But these are all in the form of additives. (They are listed at the end of the ingredient list.) Essentially, they've ground up a bit of a vitamin pill into each bar. Obviously, there's no need to eat candy to get powdered vitamins. If you want the extra vitamins--just take a vitamin pill!<br /><br />5. While they were at it, they added 5% DV of sodium per bar.<br /><br />I am not opposed to enjoying junk food now and then. If these bars tasted great, I might indulge in one as dessert from time to time. However, there's lots of junk food I like better...so I won't bother with these bars.

Likewise, both the fillings and the crusts are sickeningly sweet and almost overpower the fact that the idea is that the bar is supposed to taste like ""real"" fruit.  Any variety of Wal-Mart's Great Value brand of cereal bars trumps these in a heartbeat.  GV's crust is more dense the sweetness is subtle, allowing pleasant fruitiness to filter though.  I highly recommend those."

The strawberry ones are the worst of all the flavors.  I bought a variety pack a couple months ago for the office, and the box of strawberry ones is still sitting here virtually untouched.  If the office people don't want them (and they'll eat just about anything), you know they aren't very good.

Sadly, most cat foods on the market have corn as their first, second, or third ingredient.  Sometimes it is both the second AND third ingredient (corn meal and another corn byproduct, etc.).  I wish I had known this fact a long time ago.  I have recently been looking for a healthier choice for my two cats and even the ones that state that they are a healthy alternative tend to contain ingredients that I would question and in amounts that are alarming.  This is the ONLY cat food at my market that does not contain corn as a main ingredient and it seems the healthiest alternative.  I have tried (through Amazon) other alternatives that are just as healthy, but sadly my cats did not like the taste.  This one they adore.<br /><br />Healthy and tasty.  I couldn't ask for more."

I tried giving this to her by itself and she sniffed and strayed off.<br /><br />My guess is that the smell or flavor is not the kind she likes.

I make lattes 2 times a day and always use Starbucks coffee beans fresh and kept in the freezer until use. From the day it arrived, this machine made horrible coffee... but since I ordered it from Amazon and spent over 800 after shipping on it I decided to give it a while to see if I could get it to work better. I adjusted the grind, and the dose and tried over and over. What I found is that the espresso was very inconsistent, the red error light would go off multiple times during use. Sometimes it would make a somewhat decent shot of espresso and then I would adjust nothing and the next time it would shoot out watery crap, or it would drip out half a shot and stop. It has been so infuriating. Finally after a month I called customer service to complain they told me I should be priming the pump with each use of the machine... which I tried, for about 2 cups I thought it was fixed then I was back to square one. Now after another month I am at my wits end. I wake up every morning hope it's going to make a decent cup, and end up drinking a watery cup of awful latte... grumpy until I decide to purchase a latte somewhere later in the day. I'm done hoping, like my husband says you can piss in one hand and wish in the other and see which one fills up first.. Today I am calling to return this awful piece of junk... and hopefully I will at least get my money back. Never will I purchase another product from this company, what a disappointment.

3035,B002PI82P0,A3JCBYYYQDCX4M,waterplant,3,It gave us trouble getting started. Kept getting an error light.  Seemed to be related to the beans not  fully filling the hopper although it looked full.  Takes longer to fill the coffee cup than one would like.  From start up to drinking coffee may be longer than 5 minutes but we did not really time it. Once running it makes good coffee but we like the flavored coffee and it does not recommend that.  Problem solved by adding some flavoring to the finished brew. Overall not that happy with it but it cost so much that I guess we are stuck with it. Return fees were so much that we decided to just keep it and try to live with the things we found troublesome.

If you like frothing, suggest Vienna Silver Plus (with steam boiler). Understand the type of coffee you use with these machines. If using oily coffee, you MUST set the grinder to coarser setting;  clean the brew group regularly AND lubricate the brew group. Oily coffee pastes and causes stress on moving parts if not cleaned/maintained.<br />This machine works BEST with true Italian roast coffee as it does not paste so minimal maintenance.

It's a little bigger and bulkier than my Krupps, but that won't matter if it doesn't break as fast as the Krupps broke. It doesn't have a digital screen, so it actually is a simpler machine. The grounds drawer is large and holds plenty, but the machine doesn't let you know when it's full and ready to be emptied. Otherwise, it's a great machine, that requires a bit of time to get used to.

3051,B002PI82P0,A2295J7IUFHKBJ,Evan Getz,5,"I recently purchased a Vienna Superautomatica as an inexpensive second espresso maker. The first thing I noticed is that it is Italian made like many of the great espresso machines. The body of the Vienna is ""graphite"" plastic, and while it does not feel first class, it somehow has a pretty sturdy feel to it. I also like that the footprint is pretty small thus taking up little counter space.<br /><br />I opened the manual, which is not particularly clear, but need not be on account of very simple operation. The Vienna has three buttons--on/off, coffee, and steam. It also has a steamer control knob and a water volume knob.<br /><br />I turned on the machine after filling the coffee and water tanks. The buttons feel Italian--you'll know what I mean if you've owned an Alfa Romeo. They are a bit clunky next to my old Capresso C1000, but they work well (for now).<br /><br />The Vienna takes a couple of minutes to warm up--I don't mind this for reasons I'll reveal in a minute. The coffee spout is adjustable up and down to accommodate a large variety of cups and mugs. Once it's ready, the coffee light stops blinking. I push the button and it begins to grind the coffee. The noise level of the machine is louder than my Capresso, but not too bad. You might wake up the house with it in the morning, but my child stayed asleep. Once the coffee finishes the grind, the Vienna immediately begins making espresso.<br /><br />My first impression was that I saw a lot more steam coming from the coffee than my Capresso. I am hopeful. The coffee also looked a bit thicker than the Capresso. After the Vienna finished I observed the cup: nice crema, plenty hot, and smells like the genuine article. I gave it a taste--wow, step aside Capresso, this espresso is richer, hotter, and a lot closer to coffee bar espresso. Next I took a sip. Ah yes, the cup holds rich chocolatey espresso. If you are sort of a coffee snob, you'll like what you taste. The coffee is much richer than the Capresso, which I attribute to hotter water and fuller extraction.<br /><br />I'm sure that the Vienna will not make good enough espresso for some folks, but to me, it still tastes better than Starbucks. It was more than $100 cheaper than my Capresso and frankly makes better espresso. I cannot yet speak to the durability of the machine, but the Vienna is now my favorite inexpensive espresso maker."
3052,B002PI82P0,A33NFTZQ9JXUO1,"Donna Tate ""Ba Ba Barista""",5,"Vienna Plus is my third fully automatic machine. I loved my first, Saeco original Vienna, hated the second, Saeco Incanto classic. The original Vienna worked for 3 years every day, making consistently good espresso before the pump gave. I should have paid for repair, but I succumbed to that stainless steel twinkle and went for Saeco Incanto classic. More expensive for sure. Worse, better said inconsistent, coffee quality, constant small problems relating to built quality concerning the brew group, the grinder and the steamer wand. After a year of irritation a pump seal has failed while making espresso, nothing like a small explosion in the kitchen in the morning, I tell ya. Well, gone back to the trusted Vienna, now with  the plus in the name. Good old days are here again .... Compared to previous- it is a lot quieter, when both grinding and steaming, it is also a lot quicker to warm up then before, steam is ready a mere 15 seconds after pushing the button. Espresso has a beautiful rich crema right out of the box, I didn't have to experiment with grind setting at all. The steaming wand (Panarello) has been redesigned and is now foolproof maker of perfect frothed foam. For the newbie I would like to add that I spent a lot of effort to find the right roast - tasted more than a few before I settled on one (Peerless Coffee Espressp Perfection) that I buy now in 5 lb. bags and keep in the freezer. I should for fairness add that I never want any other coffee through the machine like some decaf or flavored stuff, so I don't miss the alternate ground coffee option that Incanto had. My priority has always been flavor and consistency and that the Vienna Plus delivers. My friends drive miles to ""see me"" and, by the way, get a cup of espresso, praising each one as ""this is the best espresso in the world"".  If that is what you desire, don't get mesmerized by stainless steel shine or computerized display magic and save yourself some money by getting this machine. You won't regret it. And I am unanimous in that. ;)"
3053,B002PI82P0,A3NIWCS5MYHRKT,asdopuiwfhepn,1,"Overall, I cannot recommend this machine.<br /><br />The machine made excellent espresso for the first few weeks we had it.  Once it was broken in, the espresso was average, and the crema was more of a large-bubbled foam.  The grinder is able to create a fine grind, but unfortunately the machine can't pass any water through it, so you have to use a mid-level fine grind.  The machine is able to adjust the amount of water used per shot, but anything more than the smallest available setting creates, well, coffee.  Not even an Americano, just coffee.<br /><br />After three months the grinder broke.  When I opened up the machine's door a broken part flew out.  Amazon sent me a new one.  One month in on the new one, the brewgroup jammed.  I thought it was broken, but after four days, the machine was able to pry itself loose.  Ground coffee was all over the brewgroup, as if it had exploded.  We'll see how it works out.<br /><br />A bright spot--Amazon was astoundingly helpful and gracious.  They replaced the first one, postage payed, express delivery, with no questions at all.  They offered to refund the original purchase price on the second one, until it broke loose and started working again.  I cannot complement them highly enough!"
3054,B002PI82P0,A2PSD2R9A1CXG7,"L. T. Beasimer ""www.LBphoto.net""",5,"We owned a Saeco Vienna Deluxe since January 2004, but decided to purchase a newer model in September 2010.  The Vienna Deluxe served us well for six and a half years, but was beginning to show its age.  The Saeco Vienna Plus is the updated version of the Vienna Deluxe.<br /><br />Saeco's Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine is simple to use.  Add up to 57 oz filtered cold water to the reservoir, up to 12 oz beans in the hopper, and then turn the machine on.  While warming up, adjust the volume dial for a 1 to 6 oz pour. Once ready, press the coffee button once to make an espresso or twice for a double shot or two espressos.  If a latte is desired, press the steam button after the espresso has finished brewing and turn the steam knob to activate the pannarello to steam the milk.  Turning the steam knob without pressing the steam button will produce hot water from the pannarello instead.<br /><br />The perfect espresso may require adjusting a couple dials in the hopper. A strength dial controls the amount of grounds used per cup.  A second knob controls the grind's coarseness. These settings are typically adjusted once then left alone if you chose to alter the factory setting.  The factory settings work well for us, so we didn't adjust these controls.<br /><br />Maintaining and cleaning the Vienna Plus espresso machine is just as simple.  Cleaning consists of a weekly (or after every 15 pucks) wipe down of the machine, rinsing off the brew group with warm water, and emptying and washing the drip tray and grounds drawer.  Incidentally, the used coffee grounds are beneficial to soil when spread out in the gardens or lawn.  Once every three months, running descaler through the boiler keeps the inner workings in good condition.<br /><br />A common complaint about Saeco Vienna espresso machines is the outer plastic cabinet.  The durable plastic cabinet was not a problem for us on the old machine, as it didn't chip, crack, or break with normal use.  The Veinna Plus uses the same plastic material for the outer cabinet, and is probably used to keep the cost down.  The internal workings, like the stainless steel boiler, are hidden from view and use more expensive materials.<br /><br />Another complaint I've read about is the grinder getting clogged.  Our local coffee shop advised us not to purchase oily beans like many flavored coffees.  If you enjoy flavored coffee, add syrup to the cup instead.  Choosing the right beans, and regular cleanings has kept us from experiencing this problem.<br /><br />Compared to the Vienna Deluxe, the Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine has an updated look, but operates the same and is similarly sized.  However the Vienna plus is quieter, and the pannarello has been improved for easier and more consistent frothing.<br /><br />Ultimately, the Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine is simple to use and maintain; plus produces a great tasting espresso and Americano.  If you're looking for a fully automatic espresso machine, this one is definitely worth considering.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Fresh quality coffee made at the press of a button<br />Makes consistently great tasting coffee/espresso<br />Simple to use<br />Easy to clean/maintain<br />Biodegradable waste is great for the garden<br /><br />CONS:<br />This espresso machine is sure to spoil its owners<br />Cannot handle large quantities quickly"
3055,B002PI82P0,AEIS2WTDM59XI,Always Shopping,5,"We had a Saeco Vienna Deluxe for several years.  The machine finally died on us.  In searching for a new machine, I saw the Saeco Vienna Plus and knew this would be the next machine.  It is very similar to our previous model.  It is much cheaper than when we had purchased our first unit.  I feel there is value in what we are getting.  It saves us a fortune from having to run to the more expensive coffee shop chains to pick up a mocha when it can easily made at home.  At the touch of a button or two, the coffee is ready to go.  The ease of use is amazing.  Clean up is easy.  I would definitely recommend this machine for those who want to be able to make espresso with ease."
3056,B002PI82P0,A1VCSQBD32DPWP,"L. Studen ""coffee lover""",5,"In about 3 minutes, this machine grinds the beans (no separate appliance needed for that!),<br />tamps down the grind (no separate tool for that!)and produces foamy hot espresso. Plus, the<br />steam is strong enough to foam up 2% milk!  Everything cleans up in a flash...second cup, no<br />long wait.  If you like strong coffee set the grind about four clicks from the maximum setting<br />and the setting for amount of coffee for each use at the max.  Lovely."
3057,B002PI82P0,ALTR89MZ6IM8T,I. Pelofsky,4,Easy to use machine that works well making espresso or just an single cup of coffee. The only complaint I have is if you are using a large cup for regular coffee you have to angle putting in and removing the cup since the bottom of the drip spouts are not high enough even when adjusting the pull-down or push-up spout that is provided. This is a well priced unit for what it provides you. You can adjust the grind of the beans but it comes manufacturer set for a medium grind. It comes with lights that once turn solid green let you know that you are ready to use whatever function you choose and dial for adjusting espresso to a full cup of coffee is clearly marked and easy to read. Steam is provided when pressing the 3rd button on - when it is off you get very hot water dispensed. The area for grinding the beans handles a lot so if you like switching types of coffee then you have to keep only the amount for what you are using in the grinder since there is no way of easily switching coffee beans once the container is full. Overall I would recommend it for anyone who likes to prepare their own coffee because of it's price and ease of use.
3058,B002PI82P0,A102QRKSKT5XMR,Tana Be,5,"We've owned this machine for 11 months and therefore can provide a longer term review. Please note we bought this on sale at Costco for $350, but it's worth more.<br /><br />Ease of use: while this is a superautomatic, don't assume you can brew a perfect cup of coffee/espresso with no experimentation. This isn't a Keurig. The advantage of superautomatics is ease of use and consistency once you've optimized brewing. Similar to semi-automatic espresso machines, you do have control over your final product. You still have to find the correct coffee grind setting/amount, etc. You still need to aim for a 25 second extraction time. Once you do, though, you'll have great results each and every time.<br /><br />Maintenance: this machine requires minimal daily maintenance. The water reservoir is small so have a water pitcher handy. Fresh water is ideal for brewing anyway. Ditto for the coffee bean hopper. But again, who wants beans sitting out going stale? Weekly maintenance involves cleaning the brew group. This is easy. Every 2-3 months the machine should be descaled. This does require time.<br /><br />Taste: we are big fans of french press coffee for its richness of flavor. This is the first ""coffee machine"" that can best a french press with less effort, less cleanup, and more consistency. The coffee is makes is excellent (termed coffee crema as it retains crema on the top), and I find it difficult to drink coffee outside the home now. The espresso it makes is equally excellent. It surpasses Starbuck's with ease, and is equivalent to espresso you'll get from most cafes. However, it's not as good as you'll find at an Intelligentsia, or similar quality cafe. But it's quite consistent. Don't forget that beans are an important variable. Try black cat espresso from Intelligentsia, preferably roasted only a few weeks in advance.<br /><br />Milk frothing: anywhere from adequate to very good. Definitely depends on type of milk and skill. I can usually make quite good foam, but it can't do true microfoam.<br /><br />Quality/workmanship: plastic outer casing and plastic brew group. Looks flimsy, but has held up over the past year. It makes a strange high pitched noise while brewing, probably from the where the coffee comes out (likely just our machine) but we've otherwise not had problems. Also, it's the same brew group used in their other machines, so taste should be equivalent to more expensive machines.<br /><br />Features: this is bare bone. No timer, no computer presets. But this is also why the price point is so good. You get a great espresso maker and decent grinder for a relatively low price.<br /><br />Speed: warms up from turn on in 2-3 minutes. Then takes (with grinding) from about 35-40 sec for espresso to a bit longer for a cup of coffee (can make a full american sized cup). Warm up for steaming is quick. To then brew after steaming takes only about 15 seconds as long as you purge hot water. So getting to know how the machine works is important.<br /><br />Summary: fantastic consistent coffee, excellent espresso with nice crema, and very good steaming at a great price. A great barista with a high end grinder and high end semi-automatic can probably make better espresso, but this is great for the rest of us. And early in the morning this is what you want."
3059,B002PI82P0,A23GUGDWLIFI84,"E. McDougall ""Hoser lost in america""",4,"Got this for Christmas about a month ago; I've put 5 lbs of beans through it so time for a quick review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Quick brew time - you get a double espresso in 2 minutes or less (from completely off).<br />2. Well-brewed espresso - good extraction, nice body and crema. No adjustments to grind or tamping required, straight out of the box. Does justice to good beans.<br />3. Excellent frother/steamer - can scald 4 oz milk to 190F 2-3 minutes from pressing the ""steam"" button. Great froth for cappuchino, extremely quick and easy compared to my (very old) DeLongi manual.<br />4. I'm getting ~15-18 double espressos from a tank of water and a fill of beans. Holds about 1.5 quarts water, and a little over 1/2 lb beans.<br />5. Simple, well-thought-out maintenance - once you figure it out.<br />6. Inexpensive.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Not the prettiest machine on the block - plastic-ey, rounded. The VW Bug of automatic espresso machines.<br />2. No ""grounds full"" indicator - you need to remember to empty it, and the drip tray, every 10 cups. Huge mess if you don't remember.<br />3. Yes, cold espresso if you use a cold cup. Not sure the extraction temperature is high enough - supposed to be about 190-195F. If you do 2 doubles in a row the second is significantly cooler.<br />4. The volume dial - I have to keep it on the lowest setting to get a reasonable 1-1.5 oz double espresso. On the highest setting it puts about 16 oz through your grounds (thus making cool, colored water).<br />5. Not very quiet; lots of grinding, clacking, and pump motor noise.<br /><br />Overall:<br />It makes really good espresso when I use good beans, and the milk frother is marvelous. It does everything I need without fuss, and quickly (which is important to me). On the other hand, it doesn't warn you when the grounds container is filled, and it needs refilling a little too frequently. It won't make American-style coffee, either; it can't heat that much water that quickly.<br /><br />Not 5 stars; but for the price it's definitely 4 stars."
3060,B002PI82P0,A3CTDUZZIBA14B,"Brian A. Hall ""Amazon Junkie!""",5,"I have had this machine for 6 months now and use it every business day.  It has worked perfectly since day one.<br /><br />I used to go to Starbucks almost daily and now I can't tell you the last time I went. It has already paid for itself! I make a mocha for a coworker daily who helps cover the costs of the beans, milk and chocolate as well.<br /><br />IMPORTANT!!!  This machine takes some tweaking of all settings to get what you want how you want it.  It also takes tweaking of finding the right beans for your taste, right chocolate if you like mochas and even a good frothing pitcher to get a good froth.  I probably spent a month before I had what I wanted exactly.  For those looking for a Starbucks like mocha I use Starbucks espresso beans and Hershey's Special Dark chocolate syrup along with 2% milk.  It's nearly the same.<br /><br />As for the machine, in my opinion very low maintenance.  Make sure you empty the grounds container fairly regularly so it doesn't back up into the inner workings of the machine and you should be fine.<br /><br />As for the negative review that seemed most helpful to others....this person is correct about the grind and water settings.  If you make the grind too fine the machine will take forever to push the water through and you will wait 5 minutes just for one shot.  The key is to adjust it slowly. Meaning just make one small adjustment at a time and then let it make several shots before deciding.  I took an old bag of beans I had and just experimented on the settings until I got the flow just right.<br /><br />To be fair, I make mocha's, I like them strong with half the normal chocolate so I can taste the coffee, BUT, it's still sweetened to the point that if you really just want cappuccino I can't tell you if it makes it perfectly.  For the money I think it does a great job.  It may seem expensive but if you research these units you will find this is one of the cheaper ones.<br /><br />As for reliability, the above mentioned reviewer seemed to have a few issues.  I have not had any in 6 months of daily use.<br /><br />As for any cons: the water tank is OK but when you make two mochas daily I have to fill it up about every 3 days.  Since this is in my office not near a kitchen this isn't horribly convenient but still...I'm not really complaining, just mentioning it.  If you are really serious about this and going to make a lot of coffee, find one that hooks up to a water supply.  Otherwise, this is just fine.<br /><br />EDITED..... 1 year later....everything above still stands....works like a charm...still making 2 a day...."
3061,B002PI82P0,A1KBHWGAKISCWZ,"J. Lowe ""Graphic Designer""",5,"I had an ""El Cheapo"" espresso/coffee combo from Krups that worked well for many years until the pump gave out. I scoured the Internet for a worthy machine that I could depend on and purchased one of the Breville espresso makers. I returned it the next day. It made terrible weak coffee. Then I happened to be wandering through Wal Mart and saw a $70.00 Hamilton Beach machine. It made great coffee with crema and it was strong enough to froth milk. The next morning, I went to make a cup and the machine had leaked all over my countertop! I was lucky to have unplugged it the night before or else there could have been an electrical fire. Back to Wal Mart it went.<br /><br />Neither of these machines were automatic and I had to grind my own coffee beans (which I prefer, even with my regular coffee). I saw the Saeco, read the reviews and said, ""If this doesn't perform, I'm not making espresso ever again."" When it arrived, I followed the ""Quick Start"" instructions and filled the hopper with my French roast beans. I crossed my fingers and pressed the ""On"" button. When all the lights were ready, I pressed the ""Coffee"" button. In about 15 seconds I had one of the most beautiful cups of espresso complete with a heady froth of crema!<br /><br />I was so impressed, I made another cup. Ahhh, heavenly. Of course, I couldn't sleep that night - the caffeine replaced the blood in my veins.<br /><br />The milk steamer wand is also mighty powerful. It froths milk just like a commercial machine. Something my Krups didn't do very well.<br /><br />In summation, this is a wonderful machine in its price range. I highly recommend it. Oh, and by the way, the clown who gave it a 1-star review? That's a hoax. There is no such wording on the box or in the manual."
3062,B002PI82P0,A3QAVOMIQ5XNK,meemee,5,"I have had this machine for a few weeks now, and love it!!!  After years of the hassle of steam machines, this is such a treat!!!  It is so easy to use, and clean that I look forward to my daily cups of espresso, instead of looking at it as a chore.  I also save counter space, as I do not have to share it with a grinder, anymore.  It is also very nice to have a HOT cup, finally!!!  Every other machine just never seemed to get hot enough.  I highly recommend this machine to all!!!:)"
3063,B002PI82P0,A2WBVYWDIITDDB,A Person from Earth,1,"I am from Italy and own a machine from this brand there. The machine over there works. The one I bought here in the USA broke after 8 months. I had to pay all the shipping costs for them to fix it, and they sent it back and it worked for a few more months. But now it broke again and it is no longer under warranty! There is not anyone in the entire state that services it, so I am stuck with a broken $500 machine. Not worth it at ALL!!! Don't buy it, the customer service is awful and the machine is not built to last."
3064,B002PI82P0,A3GG0ISOMQYKD8,Maria A Guglielmo,1,"I purchased this espresso machine on-line after having an older version for over 8 years.  I had neglected the older machine quite a bit in terms of descaling, etc, had shipped it twice all over the US and never had a problem with it.  This new machine arrived and the plastic front was loose and very flimsy.  Still, it seemed similar to the old one and I set it up.  Within a month the entire machine just died.  It wouldn't turn on.  I contacted customer service and shipped the whole machine off.  After over 6 weeks it returned, this time it worked for about a week before shutting down with the brew group in a jammed position.  I contacted customer service again and asked for my money back.  They refused and sent me an email on how to take the brew group with a screwdriver.  5 screwdrivers, a stripped screw and 1 allen's wrench later, I finally managed to reset the thing.  For the moment, it is working but the espresso is barely warm when it comes out, not piping hot like it should be.  The 8 year old Saeco, by the way, is still chugging along after I cleaned it out. Sadly, I cannot recommend this machine or brand anymore."
3065,B002PI82P0,A22LFANACXF9PT,"RJ ""Strategy is Better Than Strength""",4,"I looked to this machine after I purchased and returned a Saeco machine costing more than 50% more than this one. Sure, it had lots of sensors, bells and whistles and a complicated milk frother, but guess what? It was dead on arrival. The machine couldn't hold its water--literally--and as it heated up water ran out the back and all over my countertop. I took it as a bad sign.<br /><br />Trust me, the more bells and whistles, the more things that can go wrong. This Vienna machine, on the other hand, hits a sweet spot. Just enough controls--grind, coffee dose, serving size, single or double shot)--and one fault sensor. The brew group (the inner assembly that makes the coffee) seems solid and is easy to remove and clean. The unit's lower cost seem to come from a cheapo-looking plastic housing they use; it's totally uninspired. Can't say it is flimsy in that I've had no probs with it so far. Besides, the coffee tastes very good, and you can't drink the housing anyway.<br /><br />I am sure there are all-metal authentico machines with big boilers and electronic controls that make a somewhat better cup, so I can't give it 5 stars. But are you a professional coffee taster? I can say that four months since purchase it has worked flawlessly and consistently. I like its coffee and the wonderful crema. Foams milk quickly as well. To keep your beverage hot, do microwave water in your half-filled cup until hot in advance of brewing (discard the water once hot unless you are going Americano).<br /><br />The critics are right when they say this unit wont pump hot water thru the finest grind settings, nor can you get true cafe Americano simply by choosing a large serving size. So stay south of the halfway mark on the serving-size dial. To go American use the micro as I suggested above and add a couple of espresso shots.<br /><br />Hard-core coffee geeks will say you can do better than this machine but I say it isn't worth it. I have been to Italy and done many shots from the ""bars"" there and I still say get this one. Save money by buying this one so you can go to Italy and study up on becoming an espresso snob!<br /><br />Oh and a warning: you will drink a lot more coffee, but you will also add a lot more bright-eyed joy to your life!"
3066,B002PI82P0,AMZCZBK1EF1PV,Michael D,1,"I edited this review in October 2012, after my machine broke.<br /><br />I bought the Saeco Vienna Plus 21 months ago to replace a much-loved and much-used Solis Master 5000. My understanding was that the Vienna Plus had basically the same internal components as my old Solis. I got over 8000 coffees out of the old Solis over the course of 8 years, before its boiler gave out. (The Solis had a digital coffee counter). I loved the Solis.<br /><br />The machine had some minor problems, for example, it seems to leak water into the drip tray (I read somewhere that's a feature, not a bug), a plastic knob broke (fixed with glue), and the dosage dials stopped adjusting. A few weeks ago, however, the machine began to smell like burnt machine gears, and as it worsened, the stench now contaminates the coffee. The cost for repair would be $150 labor, plus $225 for a new grinder ($350 total). Less for a used grinder. I'm 9 months out of the 12-month warranty. We make an average of 3 espressos daily.<br /><br />I would *not* have bought this machine had I known the experience I would have. I have lowered by rating from 5 stars, to 1 star. I agree with the sentiment of some other reviewers that this superautomatic machine makes most sense if you don't expect longevity. Assume a lifetime of 1-2 years.<br /><br />Another point of interest, if you follow the Solis/Saeco product line, is that there is no water-level detector. The machine just runs, and if the water runs out, it times out (it does not overheat). You just refill the water tank, re-prime (e.g., run the water wand for a few seconds) and make the coffee again.<br /><br />I'm replacing it with a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S51RQG"">Breville Barista Express BES860XL Machine with Grinder</a>, which requires an extra step when making an espresso, but after watching several videos, I think the BES860XL will taste much better, and be a convenient part of my morning espresso."
3067,B002PI82P0,AKZTPKUF24X6M,Picky picky picky,5,"Update #1, I've owned it for over 1 year and make 6 shots per day. It makes excellent espresso and has worked perfectly. I have upgraded it from 4 to 5 stars. It's still a bit noisy and inexpensive looking, but it works great.<br /><br />Original review... My impression upon unpacking is that there's a lot of plastic used everywhere visible. In fact the only metal visible is on the frothing wand.  At the price point I don't object, but be ready for it. The plastic used is similar to that used in model cars and planes, rigid, but possible breakable.  It is, however, reassuringly thick and I expect it to be durable.<br /><br />The Vienna Plus has a ""form follows function"" look as opposed to ""styled"".  To my eye it's sort of an R2D2 look.  Another reviewer said VW Beetle looking...I can see that too.<br /><br />My hand fits into a recess in the back of the water tank perfectly making it a cinch to remove and carry.  Frothing the milk is very easy.  Depress the steam button, wait for the green light and twist the steam valve knob on the right hand side until the water spurts stop and only steam comes out.  Twist the knob the other way to stop the steam, submerge the tip of the wand in your cold milk and reopen the steam valve. That's it.  You don't have to do anything else because the ""Panarello"" wand draws air in from the top.  That means you don't have to keep the tip just at the milk's surface, submerged works just fine.<br /><br />After you froth the milk it takes quite a while to cool the boiler enough to make espresso.  If you ""un-depress"" the steam button, open the steam valve and run some water through the wand it will cool the boiler enough to stop the blinking ""too hot"" lights in a few seconds.<br /><br />Both the grind and quantity of ground coffee can be adjusted whilst it's grinding.  Mine remains at the mid range factory settings.  The espresso comes out hot and rich with lots of crema.  It does make noise during the pre-brew, brew and grounds expelling process.  For maintenance, removing the brew unit to rinse under hot water is very easy.  I'm impressed with the ease of use, maintenance and the flavor of the espresso."
3068,B002PI82P0,A299RL1MN9S024,Rosalinda,4,I received this espresso maker as a gift. Although I like the look and style of the machine and how easy it is to make a quick espresso what I don't like is that the espresso is never hot. I always have to preheat the cups in the microwave for 30 seconds in order for the coffee to retain its' warmth while I drink it.
3069,B002PI82P0,A25O9GH8MSJO77,D. Frederick,4,"I recently purchased a Saeco Vienna Plus to replace a Vienna Deluxe model that provided great service for eight years. We make about 24 shots of espresso a week, on average, so over the eight years the old machine pumped out about 10,000 shots. I felt we got our money's worth from that machine and was eager to replace it with another Vienna Deluxe.<br /><br />When I went to do my research, however, I found that Saeco had discontinued the Vienna Deluxe model. The Vienna Plus appears to be the only current model in the old Deluxe form factor. I initially was tempted to buy up into one of the pricier ""Giro"" machines, mostly for the more stylish design. But after talking to a couple of Odea and Talea Giro owners, and reading lots of online reviews, I decided these more expensive machines also might be a little more temperamental. So, I chose the Vienna Plus.<br /><br />It's only been about three weeks, but so far the Vienna Plus is meeting my expectations. The main difference between the old Vienna Deluxe and the new Vienna Plus is in the boiler. I assume the Deluxe model had two boilers, one for coffee and one for steam. (I think Saeco is now calling this feature ""Rapid Steam"".) I assume that because there was no wait time between steaming and brewing, or brewing and steaming. I always steam my milk first, and the Plus model makes me cool down the boiler from steaming temperature to brewing temperature before brewing the espresso. That's easy: you just disengage the ""steam"" button and open the steam control to run hot water through the wand. After less than a shot's worth of water comes out, the ""brew"" light comes on and you can brew your coffee. The wait time for this is under five seconds.<br /><br />Other than that small difference, I'm finding the Vienna Plus comparable to the Vienna Deluxe in terms of both the quality of the coffee it produces and convenience. Who knows how long the new machine will last, but if it comes anywhere near the eight years I got from the Vienna Deluxe I'll be delighted with the investment. Speaking of investment, while the list price on the Vienna Plus is similar to what I paid for the old Deluxe model, the street price on the Plus model is quite a lot lower. I was able to get the Vienna Plus from a local warehouse store for $380 including business delivery. California sales tax ran the total to about $416, but even so I paid about $200 less for the Vienna Plus than I paid for the Vienna Deluxe eight years ago."
3070,B002PI82P0,ADLZRP567PR7R,CapeCod,5,"We bought an Incanto Sirius at twice the price. It looked Marvelous with it's stainless and digital exterior. It cleaned it's self and did interesting tricks with the display. Then on the third day it went bizerk and consumed a full hopper of Lavazza Oro without delivering a single cup of coffee. The seizure was fatal and the machine could not deliver another cup. Oh did it hurt being coffeeless after those three days of pleasure with the cost of a short vacation.<br /><br />Returning the Incanto Sirius to the store, I came home with the Viena Plus. It is a little plasticy looking and the tray does not click into place the way the Incanto did. There is a blinking green light to indicate that the machine is warming instead of an LCD temperature indicator. There is only one boiler that has to be shared for seam and brewing. It is somewhat Spartan in fact.<br /><br />The coffee brewed by the Viena Plus is excellent. The crema is thick and rich. Frothed milk climbs vertically out of the cup. The dreggs pucks are firm and lightly moist. There is no leaking and very little spillage from the brew group which is easy to remove and clean. This machine might not be the expensive, flashy, big show, high maintenance beauty queen, but it does deliver at about half the price."
3071,B002PI82P0,A155MJHCVAWN77,JulesH,1,"As with most Saeco products the life expectancy is less than 2 years, and then the price to fix the broken pump or the leaky insides cost more than the machine itself. I have been through 2 in less than two years and the warranty requires you to pay for the shipping (heavy machine) and they won't guarantee that they will fix it, and then you have to pay to have it sent back. I regret ever looking at the machine - next time a Breville - my daughter has had hers for 5 years with no issues, ever."
3072,B002PI82P0,A16MERDK3W9YLZ,Giacfoli,4,"I grew up in Italy where I owned and operated a cafe' with my family. Needless to say I am very picky about proper espresso making. Although the Vienna has a plastic-like appearance, it is a very good machine overall. The crema is consistent, the frother works very well.<br />It will take some time to learn the proper combo of grinding size, dose,type of water and beans,but your espresso will turn out to the best of your expectation. If the machine is on sale, don't hesitate to buy it. Two friends of mine have had it for 7 years, and the quality of the coffee is still excellent.<br />My only complaint is the temperature of the coffee; it could be a bit higher, and I wish it had a cup warmer at the top."
3073,B002PI82P0,A3HYOFZFDR4C7T,Aynur,4,"This is my first automatic machine, I had bought a manual one before this one but it was a pain to use.  It may not look as fancy as some other ones, but it does an excellent job.  It's relatively easy to clean, and Saeco's customer service is excellent if you have any issues.  I had contacted them about the panarello (frothing wand) that I was having issues with and they sent me a new one under the 1-year warranty within 3 days!  I use it mainly for making lattes, mochas, and caramel machiattos.  All of which turn out even better than Starbucks, even though I use their beans, mocha powder, vanilla syrup, and caramel sauce.  All in all, I give this machine a 4, not because of how it works but only because it is a little plastic-looking."
3074,B002PI82P0,A7AX9AMW2OS1T,Alexandra,4,"This is the 3rd machine I got (bought the 1st one in 1999 in Germany) and it has constantly been the same quality. It usually needs to be repaired after roundabout 4 1/2 years. If you like a good coffee with no what we call 'SchnickSchnack' (that means no Cappuccino, no Latte etc., just Coffee) go for this one. My new machine is - compared to the 2 I had before - actually a little bit noisier, which doesn't bother me as long as the coffee tastes good. Depending on the coffee beans you use, you will have excellent coffee. It's a good price, actually it's gotten cheaper througout the years. Anyways, you cannot compare a SAECO to a JURA (which, in my opinion is too expensive). If you want good coffee for a reasonable price, buy this one."
3075,B002PI82P0,AFU75NX4Y9WA8,wh,4,"I tried a De'Longhi BAR32 pump driven espresso machine, and was very disappointed.  I've returned that unit.  It was simply ineffective.  Boiler capacity too small, can't make doubles, too cold, can't froth any reasonable amount.  Just not good.  I had a Saeco/Starbucks pump driven espresso machine previously, which finally failed after 12 years of service.  The Saeco/Starbucks was a pretty good machine that performed well - fully manual.  However, it finally bit the dust.<br /><br />So, I tried the Saeco Vienna Plus.  Sure, it's a lot more money, however it does a lot more and (though I've only used it for 2 days) it has performed very well.  No problems on capacity.  It can make double, or quadruple shots with ease.  It heats up very quickly, and has very good capacity.  I never thought I'd like a ""super automatic"" but now I'm loving it.  Frother works perfectly fine.  About the only thing I can say I wish it did were one thing.  That would be an easier way to swap out coffee beans in the hopper so I could do Decaf later in the day.<br /><br />Instructions are simple - maybe a little too simple.  I'm still not clear on instructions to clean the brew assembly.<br /><br />Setup was very easy and straightforward.  The unit worked perfectly out of the box.  Espresso can be dialed in great, and quality is excellent.  Frankly, it makes brewing an espresso or capuccino so easy and fast and so good that I'll be making WAY more.  So long as my experience stays consistent with the past two days, I'm very happy."
3076,B002PI82P0,A30ZTBKDAA8B1V,Dennis Charlebois,4,"I had been looking for a combo grinder, espresso, cappuccino machine for a while. I've seen Saeco units before and find them to be adequate for the ""less than $1,000"" purchase.<br />Pros - Great coffee, easy to set up, a little quirky on operation but once you get used to it is wonderful<br />Cons- Too many plastic parts...worried about thinks breaking. Also, sometimes when you add new water you have to ""prime"" the water circuit...seems odd. Also after using the steam, you have to vent the steam line to go back to using the grinder. Not sure why this has to be done...seems odd"
3077,B002PI82P0,A3GM4KUYEQ7BJ7,David Conrad,5,"This machine is for the serious coffee connoisseur.  It has an adjustable conical burr grinder that creates the perfect grind for a premium espresso. Not only can you change the fineness of the grinds and the amount of water used but also the amount of ground coffee used to make each individual cup from 6 to 9 grams.<br /><br />I've tried it with my favorite gourmet coffee, Caffe Bomrad Torino from Italy ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NV44AE"">Caffe Bomrad Torino, Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2 Lb/1 Kg Bag</a> ) and needless to say, the result was amazingly superb! A divinely perfect espresso with a crema so thick the sugar cube floats!!!"
3078,B002PI82P0,A35J7TSBAIOIPH,BradyBunch,3,"This is my second Super Automatic Espresso Maker. It's the lowest priced model available and is pretty good considering the price. The lack of extra features is not a problem. However there are some issues you might like to know before buying. Overall, it makes a decent espresso at the touch of a button. It's easy to clean and maintain and for that alone it's worth it since it saves you so much time.<br /><br />The quality of the espresso is decent - not bad, but not great either. It's far superior to drip coffee and easier than grinding your own beans. It took about a week to get the dosage and grinder settings to where I was satisfied. The defaults didn't use enough beans and the grind was too course which made the espresso quite bitter. You don't want run too much water through the grinds once the initial flavor is extracted.<br /><br />The temperature of the espresso is a little low. It's fine if you drink it right away or don't add cold milk. The only other little issue is the frother dispenses quite a bit of water before the actual steam. Therefore you have to use a second cup and run it for a few seconds until the steam flows consistently, then switch to your milk so you don't dilute it. Not a big deal but my last machine didn't require this step.<br /><br />Finally, the last issue has to do with the horrible packaging. The main box is contained in an outer box that's almost twice its size. The problem is there was NO PADDING whatsoever in the outer box, so the inner one is left to get slammed around throughout its entire shipping journey. My machine become separated along the main seam that runs all the way around the unit so it didn't even close properly until I pushed it back into place - there's still a small crack on one of the plastic pieces. Also, some of the buttons popped off. I would have returned it but it's kind of a hassle to ship something so large and it still works okay, so not a big deal, but wouldn't order one from here again.<br /><br />The bottom line is Super Automatic Espresso makers are an amazing convenience for those who appreciate fresh coffee. The quality is much better than the pod makers and far easier than grinding your own beans and making a whole pot at a time. The espresso isn't as good as a manual machine and this model doesn't have any fancy features, but still an amazing value for the price."
3079,B002PI82P0,AGKOX5GG5ZQ9N,R. Garber,3,"This coffee maker is just ok.  My husband wanted it so we got it but it's not that great. It has good features, but when it comes down to the coffee, it doesn't make a full cup and it's not very hot and it's really loud. I don't think it was worth the money but my husband loves it. Now we have two coffee makers on the counter."
3080,B002PI82P0,A3NS8IYQNXBSIU,David Ritter,1,Didn't last 2 years.  Saeco wanted me to ship it to/from an authorized dealer and pay for the repairs.  I can't figure out why I want to throw good money after bad.
3081,B002PI82P0,A1EV9QOJR3Y154,dad the project man,5,"I admit it, I am a espresso snob.  It's either Americanos or straight up espresso shots for me so I can really taste the quality of the espresso shots that the machine makes.  I have found that Saeco Vienna machines make the best espresso.  The reason why I just bought this particular machine is because my old Saeco Vienna (which I loved immensely) died yesterday.  I bought the old one in either 2004 or 2005.  I have used it everyday (3-5 shots per day) for the last 7+ years!  To me it is amazing that any kitchen appliance could last that long in this day and age.  Very good product!  It is super easy to ""clean"" and maintain.  My form of cleaning is to pull the main mechanism out (very easy) about 2 times a month and rinse the whole thing in the sink and set it out to air dry for the day.  Probably not even close to the amount of cleaning the manufacturer recommends, but it's just that easy and like I said...7+ years!"
3082,B002PI82P0,A32VE3HAS9NF8T,Maggie,5,"This machine makes great espresso! Very easy to use and once you regulate the grind to your preferance, it's an easy push of a button and you get to enjoy a great coffee! I highly recommend this product."
3083,B002PI82P0,A2KC0H1MB1BVFJ,Cribz@USAEUR,2,"This machine has been fantastic for the first 2 months. However, out of no where it has jammed up and has been quite difficult to get repaired under warranty. with this said i regularly clean it as prescribed. You would think a great product that produces outstanding brew would be repaired and/or replaced at the price paid. No such luck. I must say the machine is a top notch pick.......but not when reliability is calculated."
3084,B002PI82P0,A1W2FT62N16TR3,Della,4,"Our sister has had this espresso maker (in black) for a while, and when visiting her recently on vacation, we decided to purchase this machine upon our return after using it at her place for a week. We paid 399.99 for it <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PI82P0"">Saeco 4038 Vienna Plus 15-Bar-Pump Super-Automatic Espresso Machine, Graphite</a>, wouldn't pay more, though.  We bought the silver-colored machine and was actually surprised that it was ALL plastic except for the grinder inside and the small silver arm-part thingie at the top of the milk frother (I discovered it was metal when I grabbed it to push it back after using it...ouch).<br /><br />Other than the plastic issue, we love this machine. Love that we can select how much coffee we want, how strong we want it, and when we want it within minutes. Would definately recommend this espresso maker for home use."
3085,B002PI82P0,A367S17ZNKMOK3,Gregory M. Lawler,5,"The Vienna Plus Automatic Espresso Machine by Saeco is by far the best Coffee Maker that I have ever owned!...It is so simple to use and makes amazing Expresso and Cappuccino!....The machine grinds the beans automatically and it is very simple to change the grind to your tastes...The machine is very simple to take apart and clean...The steaming mechanism froths the milk very quickly and is also very easy to clean....For the price, this is the best coffee machine on the market....I have cut my Starbucks Credit card into 50 pieces because of this machine...Thanks to Saeco for making a truly affordable machine that makes ""Coffee House"" quality drinks!"
3086,B002PI82P0,AOQI3WJOSZXJU,Floyd Mann,5,"Our first Saeco lasted a good 5 years, still works, but the pump is going out. We decided to replace with another Saeco and Amazon had the best price. We never had a problem during the warrenty period, had great coffee several times a day. Definitly would recommend Saeco and Amazon."
3087,B002PI82P0,A2YQRHZPW1E30B,H. Brings,3,"Had it for 4 weeks making 1-3 cups per day. Works really well. I did not have to tweak the factory settings, they suit my taste perfectly. I use Lavazza beans in the machine and the taste is great. Easy to clean. I have to admit that the buttons and the finish overall seem cheap, but I care more about the quality of the coffee and THAT is wonderful. One more observation: i have seen the price of this machine bounce from under $400 to over $500 in 4 weeks on amazon.<br />Edit after 4 months: machine works flawlessly, easy to clean, I now adjusted the bean quantity and the result is immediate and predictable. Good buy.<br />Edit after 7 months: machine worked well until yesterday when it quit pulling in water. I tried everything to get the water into the unit but it just quit. Amazon will let me return it."
3088,B002PI82P0,A19VMTQEKKZDVX,Angelica,4,"I'm enjoying my first machine very much! My only complaints are the plastics that don't line up and the small water container.<br /><br />My best friend bought the Starbucks machine and was jealous of my ViennaPlus, because it gives better shots and is automatic for hundreds of dollars less!<br /><br />I love this machine, and I would recommend it to everyone. :)"
3089,B002PI82P0,ARR3OWG1PPMJI,golfnut,5,"I don't usually leave reviews, but felt I should say something about this wonderful machine.  We bought the Vienna Deluxe in 2002, averaging about 6 cups of coffee a day between my wife and myself.  I understand the Vienna Deluxe and Plus are very similar, most importantly it shares the same brew group design and grinder.<br /><br />Its 9 years of service includes 4 years in a foreign country hooked to a 110/220 1500W transformer (on spotty voltage, I might add, based on occasional flickering/dimming of lights in the house), and surviving being shipped back and forth.  During the outgoing journey, the plastic water container broke, probably through rough handling of the box, but the Vienna itself was fine once we got the replacement water container.<br /><br />5 years in USA was using soft water, filtered through a reverse osmosis system.  4 years in a foreign country was hard tap water.  I don't believe I've descaled it more than 3 times ever.  I usually clean the brew group once every couple of months.  Yep, we're not good models of consistent maintenance, and it's a tribute to the Vienna that it has stood up to years of abuse without ever breaking down.<br /><br />We used a variety of beans, including oily Starbucks, Lavazza, Illy, Malabar Gold Espresso (my personal favourite) and a handful of other varieties, although recently we've largely been using the cheap Starbucks large packs at Costco.  We're not coffee fanatics, but do have pretty high expectations, and the Vienna does not disappoint.  However, coffee is a personal taste, and your mileage will probably vary.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it depends on what you're looking for.  If you want pretty designs with shiny stainless steel, you'll have to pay more, and not necessarily for better coffee or better reliability.  Avoiding complex electronics and touchscreens in a damp environment sounds like a smart thing for me.  I like simple, reliable designs that performs consistently, and would look for another Vienna when mine eventually dies.<br /><br />About the only thing that I wish for, is an alternate way to feed in a different coffee powder so we can occasionally have some variety."
3090,B002PI82P0,A2JCK7U4BEDLBN,Scott Ullrich,5,After my aging Saeco Incanto Sirius decided to stop working I needed to find a replacement and fast!  Initially I was a bit surprised how much cheaper this model was vs the others but after receiving the unit and giving it a trial run I am super impressed!  Machine warms up much faster than the Incanto.  Spent  coffee material is in a nice compact circle shape making it much less messy than the previous machine.<br /><br />Overall I am quite surprised that this model works so well for the money!  If you are on the fence go for it!
3091,B002PI82P0,AREESECQL30H3,Jack Schreur,4,"This is my first super automatic machine, after two Saeco automatic espresso machines. The build quality of this machine isn't great--it is a big hunk of plastic. But that helps keep the price down to a rational level and it is a trade I'm willing to make. Care and maintenance is easy but important to do--I suspect that most folks who have issues are letting that slide. The quality of the coffee is quite good and it is very easy to make everything from a ristretto to a lungo or americano. It may take a few days to get the adjustments set correctly for your tastes--but it isn't difficult to do. Steaming is simple once you understand that after steaming you need to turn off the steam button and release the pressure before making coffee again. the machine heats up very quickly and is ready within a minute or so from powering on. The only real negative is the water reservoir capacity is a little on the small side and you will fill it often. The bean capacity on the other hand is quite large. If you drink lots of coffee or regularly frequent espresso shops this machine may save you money over time as it clearly costs less to make at home vs a shop and we don't throw out any leftover pots of coffee anymore. Overall the machine is a good value and Saeco is a respected name in Italian espresso manufacturers. I don't expect it to last forever, the plastic structure will prevent that. If I get three years of use from it I will consider myself money ahead."
3092,B002PI82P0,AYRG49WSFB84D,"M. Wieg ""Picky consumer""",2,"I was excited to receive my machine yesterday, but disappointed when I opened it.  The case is made of flimsy plastic and was off center.  My husband was able to snap it pretty much back in to place.  But the door was loose, and the panarello was loose and flimsy.  I made some espresso and cappuccino with it, and it turned out OK. But I'm returning it because I just can't live with the build quality. I'm really surprised that no one mentioned the build quality in the reviews I read.  It was much lower quality than the previous Saeco Incanto Rondo that it was replacing, which gave me years of good service.  I'm going to try another brand. I ordered a DeLonghi ESAM 3300 Magnifica instead.  I'll see how that one does."
3093,B002PI82P0,A1YWQX1I31SMIT,Scott T,5,"We had a Barista model for ~12 years that wore out.<br />After a trip to Italy, we wanted to get another machine.<br />Our original machine had a burr grinder built in, but everything else was manual.<br />It might seem lazy, but I wanted a machine that was easy to use and this model had good reviews and the price was lower than many other automatic espresso machines.<br />The espresso comes out at the right temperature and the nozzle for steaming milk does the job without having to play around with the milk.  For foam on our original machine you had to move the nozzle to the top of the milk.<br />It is easy to use, quick enough to be used all the time and the cappucino tastes as good as the stuff we were drinking in Venice.<br />We have had the machine for ~1 month now and I'm really satisfied with the Vienna Plus!"
3094,B002PI82P0,A360D64OUHLDR1,Tanya,5,"We had a previous generation of this machine for 8 years and never had one problem with it, so when the time came to look for another, we looked nowhere else. This machine is even better: quieter, better adjustments are provided. Love it, love it, love it!"
3095,B002PI82P0,ACKHZPZF86F9X,Heinz Imhof,5,This is the best automatic coffee maker for your dollar. It functions identical to the famous Swiss Made SOLIS Master 500. It does not have any features that you pay for and will never use. The bottom line is that it produces delicious coffee and is very simple to operate and maintain.
3096,B002PI82P0,AE36DMD0U2714,Benjamin Hardisty,5,"This machine was recommended to me by a former employee of Starbucks, who said that for a mid-range machine it simply cannot be beat.  To be frank, I owned a Rancilio Silvia when I did my Master's degree, all 3 years of it in fact.  The Rancilio was great, but it took real finesse and way too long to make quality drinks.  This machine, with the right settings for you, will churn out quality cappuccinos in less than 5 minutes.  I should add however, as a caveat, that it makes better lattes than cappuccinos.  I've had the Saeco for 3 weeks now and it works amazingly well.  Every morning I wake up, turn it on, grab a mug, get dressed, go back to the kitchen, hit brew and I have a perfect double shot of espresso in about 1.30 minutes.  It takes another 2 minutes to steam the milk.  All in all not a bad machine for a busy full-time PhD student! If it's fast enough and makes espresso well enough for me, it should for anybody.  Also, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! If you don't, I have a suspicion based on the one time I didn't and it got weird quickly, you can avoid any problems.  Finally, don't forget to descale the machine every month or so if you're a heavy user.  So, go out, grab yourself a Saeco Vienna, call up your math. friends and get rocking & rolling! Espressos and biscottis for all!"
3097,B002PI82P0,AYV0BK0VL7IV0,DudeSaus,4,"I bought this as a treat for my business partner and me because we were always leaving the office and spending lots of ""our bucks"" and Starbucks! When I initially set it up, I found it very easy to figure out and was especially pleased with the quality of the shots that were coming out. Nice rich crema and very hot! Of course the flavor is all in the coffee you buy. You can put to large coffee cups underneath to brew to cups at once which is nice.  I also love that you can adjust the grind and amount of coffee per shot. Sometimes you want it strong, sometimes just a regular cup of coffee strength is nice too.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that you can't change out the coffee beans once you fill the grinder. Not a big deal but it would have been an option I would have chosen in a machine if I had known. I'm also not that thrilled with the plastic build. I know it's hard to find things that aren't made of plastic at a good price, but this one is just a little too ""plasticky"" in it's appearance.<br /><br />Now the big gripe - the steaming wand! It worked pretty well, although it seemed to take about a minute to froth a pitcher of milk. When I took it off to clean it thoroughly, it never quite fit right again and would constantly pop off mid-steam. I would adjust it it and adjust it but to no avail, it would keep popping off.  I found an OEM replacement for it here - [...] and now it works like A DREAM! Consistently frothy milk in less than 30 seconds! I don't know why they didn't make this the wand that is included, but it made the difference between almost sending this thing back to bragging about it to everyone I know! If you already own this machine, definitely spend the 18 bucks to buy the new wand and you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />In conclusion, I bought this espresso machine because of the price point. Amazon had the best price I could find! I don't think I would buy this one again, but I would definitely buy a Saeco. After much research, people are always pleased with Saeco and I would have to say, other than that pesky wand, I am pleased with this machine's ability to perform daily and consistently offering up rich espresso with great crema. Next time, I would buy one that allowed me to switch out the coffee and perhaps one that was a little more attractive."
3098,B002PI82P0,ANYEBUW7ENXAK,Tom F.,4,"Very fast and easy to use once you learn how.  More importantly, excellent espressos and cappuccinos.  Very easy set up and clean up.  Has me drinking way too many cappuccinos these days.  My only criticizm is the user manual is awful, particularly explaining the dose and grind features.  If you set the dose too high and the grind too fine, it reduces the brewing to a very slow drip.  It took me a while to get this set right, as I prefer strong coffee.  The double dose feature also causes problems with brewing (very slow).  The user manual doesn't explain this at all.  Having said this, I was able to figure it out although I used about a pound of beans getting it set for my taste.  If it weren't for this I would have given it five stars.  Overall, I love this machine."
3099,B002PI82P0,A15KX6HZPCCLTV,shoobe,4,"I've used a Jura Capresso at work for the last year and loved the coffee that it makes.  I'm not a milk-in-my-coffee guy so don't have a need for the steam wand but the coffee this makes is superior to any drip machine I've tried.  I especially like the fact that you can get a single cup and don't have to pay the high price per cup for the k-cups or similar.  In addition, the grounds are compostable and the coffee is much better.<br /><br />Machine works well, reheats for the 2nd cup almost instantly."
3100,B002PI82P0,A2T8AY9Y9BC0XU,Al G. Burdulis,5,OK my krups machine (exact same engine) is 12 years old  at 9 years the heater block needed replacement (i never descaled the machine) all it does is create fantastic espresso (3-4 cup per morning) for 12 years.  PHENOMENAL!!!!  i clean it once a week.  I bought a saeco for the office and it is 5 years old with 40+ people griding it all day and it just performs  unbelievable value
3101,B002PI82P0,AG5CM9TBOGHKH,Michael,4,"I bought this unit as an upgrade a month ago, to replace my manual Breville machine. From the get go this machine performed very well. In the short time between my Brevilles design, purchase and my subsequent use, the tech has come a long way to ""more affordable."" this machine is great for those who don't want to have to do all the work and have an extra grinder appliance on the side.<br />This machine pulls great shots, with a fully adjustable grind and volume controls to tweak the shots to your preference. On a whole the machine is quite easy to control and seems to require very little upkeep at present.<br />You'll read that the unit can seem to have a cheap feel due to the use of plastic just about everywhere, and this is true. It's the trade off I think for getting such a good unit for such a low cost. I recommend this unit for anyone looking to upgrade that has some cash but don't feel like breaking the bank."
3102,B002PI82P0,A3HX25VTNXSTL6,Leo,5,"Drip coffee was not getting the job done for us. We had a Saeco Incanto Deluxe previously and after several weeks of research, friends testimony and demonstrations we selected a Saeco Vienna Plus. This machine offers some of the advantages of higher end machines at a very affordable price. The only addition we desired was a dual boiler (one for coffee and one for steam)but price was a factor. Now that we have used it for a few weeks the double boiler would be nice, but the time hassle of going from steam to coffee is not as bad as we thought. This machine, with Lavazza Super Crema beans, makes great coffee. We have the grind on number 7 (finer) and the strenth to about 3/4 of Max.<br />Minor negatives - the front cover is very 'plastic' but works fine and the water tank is only just big enough and would be a hassle at a big dinner party. Apart from that we love this machine. Cleaning is easy, the bean hopper is large and accessable, the drip tray holds a lot. The machine is reasonably quiet. Saeco make the best steamer wands in the business so perfect milk every time. Overall - Just get one!"
3103,B002PI82P0,A1A7JFUYCA3X1H,3gh,4,"the coffee it makes is just as good as the more expensive ones. i've had one before that has the extra features and i don't miss them. if at all, the only thing i miss is the bypass doser for brewing preground coffee which i only use to run a blank shot. it warms up the brew group and helps to get a hotter coffee. it's easy to switch from brewing to frothing and vice versa if you know how so the dual boiler feature really means nothing to me. it's so easy to maintain. lastly, you can't go wrong with the price."
3104,B002PI82P0,A19ZFHEYRHSLEP,Bear at Work,5,"This is my second Saeco coffee maker in 8 years...the first one finally gave in to it's age and use.  I ordered a new one ASAP because instant coffee just doesn't cut it and if this one lasts another 8 years, I'll buy a new one again.  You really can't believe the difference that this coffee makes provides.  It doesn't matter what brand of coffee you use, this Saeco will make it taste 10 times better."
3105,B002PI82P0,A2YD19TRSED0K9,Bob,3,"We had a manual Saeco (Starbucks Barista) espresso maker for many years and decided to give one of these automatic machines a try. After about 10 days of fiddling with grind, amount of coffee ground, and amount of water we have reached what is probably the best this machine can do. While it's true that this machine is much easier and less messy to deal with than our old machine it does not make nearly as rich and wonderful a cup of espresso. That being the desired goal of any espresso maker I can only give it 2 1/2 stars. I gave it 3 because 2 1/2 wasn't a choice. I hope this helps anyone who is thinking of ditching their old manual machine for a new automatic one."
3106,B002PI82P0,A1I9D06SDCXKZY,massimo,3,"Not very pleased with the performance of this machine: the espresso is very good but it doesn't come out hot, you have to preheat the cup ahead of time in order to be OK."
3107,B002PI82P0,A3LM0MMBTSYWBJ,DisplacedMic,2,"As a child and even as a younger adult I remember being bewildered at how much time, effort and frustration my parents wasted on various coffee and cappuccino machines.  They always seemed to spending inordinate amounts of money on what seemed to me to be a bad and unrewarding habit.  What more, it seemed that the more money they spent on a device, the more often it broke.  This seemed even crazier to me as the $20 coffee mate worked fine - for 10 years.  and there was no discernible difference in taste.<br /><br />Then I had kids.  Everything changed.  I don't want to drink cokes anymore and i can't drink swill coffee.  I like the good stuff.  I now understand why people will pay upwards of a thousand dollars for a good coffee machine.  It's crazy, but I understand.<br /><br />So - we bought this $500 coffee maker & nothing has changed w/ the passing of the torch i guess.  It has been nothing but a headache.<br /><br />When this machine works, I love it.  The coffee is good - the lattes are very good.  I like the footprint.  Use is simple.  The problem is it is completely inconsistent.<br /><br />I turn it on.<br />The hopper is full.<br />The water is full.<br />The grind filter is empty.<br />the drip tray is clean.<br />the brew group is clean.<br />the device is primed.<br />I press the coffee button.<br /><br />Scenario A:<br />Grind grind grind, drip drip drip - red light.<br />I push it again, perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />Scenario B:<br />Grind grind grind, drip drip drip -  red light<br />I push it again, no coffee<br /><br />Scenario C:<br />Grind grind grind - No drip, Red light<br /><br />Scenario D:<br />Consistent cups of coffee, first time.<br /><br />Scenario D never happens.  The rest happen about equally.<br /><br />I simply can not figure out what i am doing wrong.  I do the same thing three times and it behaves three different ways depending on its mood i guess. I feel like a lab rat trying to pull a lever for my food pellet."
3108,B002PI82P0,A3NIHIQVVSRTM3,Michael Sanford,3,"Convenience is probably the best feature of this machine but a machine that heats, grinds, steams, packs and pumps is bound to compromise somewhere and this machine is no exception.  The Vienna Plus will not pump coffee at the finer grind settings.  On the other hand, coffee at the factory setting is not bad.<br />I drink my coffee black which means that the taste is not obscured by milk, froth, or spices.  But coffee straight from the Vienna Plus is muddy, foamy, and poorly filtered. Since I like the speed with which a cup can be produced on this machine I pour it through a chemex paper filter and lo! poor coffee<br />is transformed into something quite good! It's not quite as good as chemex coffee made manually but it's in the ball park and it is much more quickly produced.<br />Other reviewers have complained about the plastic housing of the Vienna Plus but I suppose a solid metal housing would cost far more.  A more serious complaint is the plastic interior. The water may be heated in stainless steel but it is poured through a plastic brew group and hot water processed through plastic is likely to release small amounts of toxins into the coffee."
3109,B002PI82P0,A13UYC2TM7NRNU,"Karen Eagle ""Paris""",2,"It was very good while it worked. We have had our Saeco automatic expresso maker for three years now.  When it arrived we thought it looked awfully flimsy for a $600 machine. We were right. After the first year, knobs and buttons started falling off, and month by month after that the tolerences opened up, and the whole thing fell apart. You could hear it creeking and groaning ever more loudly as it did so. Finally, after three years, it's dead.  You get what you pay for: in this case you'll pay $500+ for great expresso/coffee for three years."
3110,B002PI82P0,A3KP9PMKZ347GK,FURIOUS,1,I purchased a Saeco Coffee grinder/maker the end of Sept 2011. It is now running continous w/o being able to turn off the grinder -- I called and found out that Saeco was bought by Phillips and they are NOT honoring warrantees on Saeco product but if I go through lots of hoops they MAY issue a refund in 3-4 weeks if they can process my order?????
3111,B002PI82P0,AV4VF64UI84OV,Gary,5,"If you love having your coffee your way you need one of these machines. Bought my first one (Spidem) about 4 or 5 years ago after visiting a relative and recently bought my second one for the motorhome... yeah, I really like my coffee... MY WAY. Dependable and easy to clean."

3114,B002PI82P0,A2E9MJ0C3LHB2Q,deborah,5,LOVE this machine.  SO easy and quick and requires little TLC and maintenance.  Been using espresso makers for over 25 years and this is best of ALL!!
3115,B002PI82P0,A3RIXRUNUJY8PQ,debi,1,This espresso was broken when we received it. This machine is Not worth the money. It is plastic and cheap.
3116,B002PI82P0,AMMT7AF96IBWL,Susan D Young,5,"We purchased this as a reconditioned unit at a much lower price than brand new. So far we have been very happy with the end result. Our coffee is frothy, foamy and delicious. We don't like super strong espresso-type coffee but love the convenience of grinding and brewing one cup at a time. We've figured out how to adjust the grind so the flavor is not so strong. This method of brewing one cup at a time is so much more environmentally-correct than the pod-type coffee makers. What the heck do you do with all those leftover plastic pods? This machine grinds the beans, compresses them and then forces the water through the compressed puck of ground coffee. Great taste and then just throw out the coffee puck. There is a bit of labor intensive cleaning, however. It needs to be kept free from clogs and oily build-up. It comes apart and cleans easily so it hasn't been a problem. We are very happy with our purchase and hope it lasts for many years to come."
3117,B002PI82P0,AEH52DGGFMPL9,yarka,5,"This is my second purchased from you. and second coffee machine. Got one for me and one for my friend.  Had this coffee machine before for !0 years but a guess it was getting old.It was time to buy new. I want the same one had just great coffee from it, and never had to worry about set it up. it is always ready in 30 second. Makes the perfect cup off coffee every time. love it"
3118,B002PI82P0,A19K1Q7MBWPXO8,Ryan G,5,"Purchased this machine for an office of approx 220 people - most of them coffee drinkers. This machine has been run near continuously for over 3 months with no signs of slowing down. The grind and volume settings for the beans allows you to fine tune the strength of flavor in the brew and the steam/water wand works well to make americanos and latte's.<br /><br />Easy to clean with removable drip tray and 'grind bucket'. Only improvement is the used grind bucket could be a little larger - we have to empty it out multiple times per day (the bucket holds about 25-30 runs worth of grinds).<br /><br />Great for the money, been very reliable for us thus far."
3119,B002PI82P0,A3851SCI6EMYXE,GM,5,"I love this machine. It makes a perfectly delicious espresso. It's pretty bulky so beware of the counter space it requires. My only complaint is that it's not a sturdy as it looks. I don't move it around so it's not a big deal for me, but it feels more flemsy that it looks. It works great though."
3120,B002PI82P0,A2VZFYKOK7JWYU,DONALD FREW,5,"The Saeco machine gives my wife and I that perfect cup of coffee brewed from freshly ground beans, at whatever time we want and in whatever quantity from 1/4 to full cup.  And, we don't have to leave home to get it!  The strength of each brew can be adjusted with the turn of a knob.  The machine is light weight and setting it up is easy.  The Saeco is easy to clean and has a nice upscale look on the kitchen counter.  Each individual cup is quickly made with the push of a button which provides a fresh hot cup rather than a pour from a pot that has been sitting on a warming plate.  There are no pods to open and change out each time, either.  We just bought another machine for my office!"
3121,B002PI82P0,A3600RDS8G4BPO,GBoy - Yachats,5,"I have owned several of these SAECO machines in Europe and everyone, including this machine, purchased from Amazon in the USA, have exceeded expectations.  They are reliable, simple to operate and produce great coffees!"
3122,B002PI82P0,A2OVIMTLNXI6KW,Michel,5,There is really nothing wrong with this unit. It make really good espresso. It heats up very fast and  is very easy to use. Why spend so much more for extra bells and whistle.
3123,B002PI82P0,A3BT1IHITD77WQ,S. Pohorecki,4,"This is the first Super Automatic Machine we've owned.  In fact, we liked it so much and from creating drinks for family & friends we ended up purchasing another for the in-laws.  We've had other espresso machines but this is the first one that was able to produce the correct heat for brewing as well as a producing the perfect steam for frothing milk.  Plus, it's a Super Automatic... Everything in one convenient package!<br /><br />My only issue is the water tank is small increasing the frequency at which you have to fill it, but for the results the machine produces it is a cost trade off.<br /><br />The price seems to fluctuate here on Amazon, but if you're patient you will score the right machine at a good price!"
3124,B002PI82P0,A39X5M57UVYNK3,cmabikeman,5,"This is a great espresso machine.  It is so nice to drink a smooth cup of espresso with the perfect crema on top.  It took some getting used to drinking espresso that was not bitter.  I have been using a stovetop espresso maker for 13-14 years.  The difference between correctly made espresso is like night and day.  My taste buds were accustomed to drinking bitter espresso at home.  Now, I am spoiled with this smooth and perfectly-made espresso.  So good, I even drink it without my usual spot of cream and sugar.  Another bonus, is the panarello steam wand.  My kids really enjoy it when I steam a cup of milk for them and then add hot chocolate mix to it.  THey get a kick out of how good the hot chocolate is.  I highly recommend this product.  You could pay more to get a machine built with an exterior of stainless steel, but why bother?  This machine's exterior of plastic is fairly sleek, high-tech looking, and handsome.  It looks good on the counter top.  Before you make yourself an espresso, remember to pour some steaming water into your espresso cup to warm it up.  I find that my espresso cups are on the cool side and tend to make my espressos turn cold rather quickly.  Go ahead and  splurge, this makes a great gift!"
3125,B002PI82P0,A1KMBUTSBTGIV5,Claudia,5,"I have to say that I am very pleased with the Saeco Vienna, even though I bought the Saeco Vienna Digital.  I purchased my unit six years ago.  I've only had one problem with it when the computer board burned out because I didn't use the stand-by mode when the unit wasn't in use during the evening.  That was fixed two years ago.  If you follow the instructions and take care of it, the unit will last you a long time.  Be sure to decalcify the machine, and turn it off when its not in use.  If it has the automatic on/off mode available, use it.  I purchase the decalcification stuff from Starbucks, but you can buy the cheaper powder from Walmart."
3126,B002PI82P0,ALEL3GUIDZOH9,Inspired,5,This is an easy to use automatic espresso machine! We use it in a salon and works great all day. Constantly get told we have the best coffee in town!!
3127,B002PI82P0,A3DNI6CVEPGGXR,Denise,5,"I just bought this Saeco coffee machine and so far it works great! I purchased it because my cousin has one in her kitchen. Everytime we visit her I am anxious for our morning coffee together. Amazon was the best price so I decided to buy one for myself. Makes coffee under one minute, fresh and ready for a cup in no time. The only downside is it's quite large, so make sure you have the space on your counter."
3128,B002PI82P0,A10BWUA2MGA9BK,average anne,5,Our deluxe Saeco quit after 12 years.  So we purchased new machine from Amazon because of the great price. So far very pleased: the Saeco Plus is quieter and is faster getting steam up for frothing the milk for Cappuccino.<br />Makes coffee comparable to well known Coffe Bar and is cost effective.
3129,B002PI82P0,A1DF2KM1E5I5OR,Tania Gerard,5,I owned the black version of this machine for over 7 years and it made wonderful coffee for every day of the 7 years. When it finally broke I was going to send it away for repair but then I saw the silver version of the same Machine at a very reasonable price and no shipping or tax and decided to purchase it instead. So far I am delighted with it.<br />Tania
3130,B002PI82P0,A2372IWC2WGM9L,happywife,5,"I bought this for my husband who has been wanting this machine for over 3 years.  Some friends of ours had this machine for over four years and love it.  I bought it for my husbands birthday and we have used it every days since and we are all in love.  At a push of a button it devlivers the perfect shot of espresso each and every time.  Our favorite part, is that all three adults in our house like our espresso differntly.  You can make a small strong shot or an make it into an entire cup.  The BEST part, it cleans it self TOO.... You cant go wrong and it delivers every time.  And as for durability, like I said our friends have had thiers for over 4 years."

3132,B002PI82P0,A1Z1HUDCIFVV2L,Evan's Mom,5,"I am just getting into making my own Mocha/Latte's and this machine was perfect for me. The instructions that came with the machine were not very detailed, but I watched some YouTube videos and learned how to froth in no time! Machine is easy to clean. We have soft water so I think that helps with the frothing. Sometimes the wand will get plugged, but if you take off the end and dip it in a little water and let steam out it seems to clear in no time."

3134,B002PI82P0,A319GZPLIF2LMZ,Lew England,3,"Bought our unit in January, 2011 and made delicious lattes for a few weeks until we had to call Saeco Customer Service for help. Our  machine leaked leaving water on the counter after every use. The knowledgable rep talked me through several checks before asking I return the unit for a repalcement. It was at this point I learned the unit purchased through a Amazon retailer had a serial# showing it had been originally  purchased at Costco.<br /><br />Our new unit arrived a week later. After three weeks it stopped working. Seems the heating unit had gone out. I made sure I contacted the same Customer Service rep who promptly - - in only two days - - replaced the unit.<br /><br />We love the coffee our Saeco makes and hope we just caught a couple of lemons. I can attest they stand behind their product and hope my new unit keeps delivering without future problems.<br /><br />We've had our unit for eighteen months now and have had to replace the on/off button multiple times. Gets less use than the other buttons but because of an obvious design flaw just comes apart. In January we bought multiple buttons from parts department. Good thing... last button lasted about three months."
3135,B002PI82P0,A1D4D8RD7P5IPA,Lynna M Lippmann,5,"I bought this as a very special Christmas gift for my parents.  My father had seen a similar model in action visiting friends and went on and on about it.  Imagine how excited I was to find it here for less than half the price I could buy it in Canada!!!  I was very excited to give it to them and hoped it lived up to the hype.  It totally did.  They LOVE it.  They have coffee all the time now.  It's very easy to use, clean and makes consistently excellent coffee with plenty of crema.  I expected to see crema on espresso shots, but I'm talking a good head of it on a cup of coffee.  It's so amazing that my dad now makes a coffee for my mom at the first sound of her moving in bed in the morning, which he has never, ever done in the past.  It totally lived up to all the hype and is well worth the money.  Couldn't be happier!"

3137,B002PI82P0,A4Z42T3HYSN4V,E. Wiler,5,"My old Digital Italia Saeco/Starbucks gave up the ghost after 6+ years. I was looking for a replacement and was very interested in this machine, seemed to good to be true. I've had the unit for a couple of days and can tell you, this is the best value on the market. The quality of the espresso is astounding, especially when you consider the reasonable price of the machine. While others may look at the plastic and complain, the proof is in the product. Simple, well designed and the most amazing value I've encountered in espresso. WAY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
3138,B002PI82P0,A2AJLW2V6QKSYC,seadog,3,"OurSpydem Digital Plus died after 8 yrs and 6500 cups of coffee - a great machine.  We bought the Saeco because it was priced in our comfort level, and we assumed it was the closest to the Spydem that died.  The Saeco makes an OK cup of coffee, however for the money it is really stripped of features we were used to. For example -no dreg drawer warning, no empty water warning, even though the manual says its there. Also no energy saving mode. Single boiler, and of course a lot of plastic. It seems all these machines are quite expensive for some reason - probably largely because they're built in Italy. Hopefully someone in the far East will catch on to the money that could be made if they were to start building these machines, and we could all be paying $300 for them.<br /><br />Added 8/12/12 - we've had the machine for about 2 years now and it has been very disappointing.  Makes an OK cappuccino, but not hot enough.  In spite of being cleaned regularly it has been temperamental, stopping in mid cycle and freezing.  Takes numerous restarts and disassemblies to get it working again.  The problem is getting worse, now it's occurring on an almost daily basis.  This is a piece of junk - spend the money and get something decent - it will be cheaper in the long run."
3139,B002PI82P0,A2TZY76PDUO7ZZ,Kathleen Bigler,3,"We've returned two of these so far.  The first had a defective heating element and the second had a defective steamer.  We might be crazy, but we're trying it a third time.  Why?  It is very easy to use and IF all the parts come as they should, then I could see this being a good deal for the money."
3140,B002PI82P0,A2JYA6PTH8MUIE,Jessica Leigh,4,"I received this espresso maker as a gift from my husband and it's pretty awesome.  I'd asked for an espresso maker and was expecting a manual machine but my husband wouldn't hear of it.  He did his research and decided on this model - primarily because an older Italian gentleman that he works with raved about it (and Italians know their espresso).  I was a bit leery when I learned how much this cost, but after having it for a few months it's absolutely worth it.<br /><br />When it arrived in the mail I was intimidated - but the setup was easy and within minutes (literally) we were making espresso shots and taste testing the various settings to see which one we preferred.  As one reviewer noted - the machine is plastic and doesn't expensive, in fact some of the parts feel like they're going to fall off if you pull too hard, but despite that, it's a sturdy machine.<br /><br />My only gripe with this product is the design of the bean loading area - it only holds about 1/4 lb of beans and sometimes the beans don't slide down to the grinder so you have to stick your hand in there and move them around so they slide into the grind area (but that only happens occasionally and shouldn't deter anyone from purchasing this model).<br /><br />When you consider that a large latte at Starbucks costs around $5 (and I was drinking at least 3 or 4 of those a week) - we'll have recouped our money on this within the year!  What a steal! :)"

We ran out quickly, so if we do a ""Full Irish"" again next St. Patrick's day, I'll probably be doubling my order, but I definitely would order again."

For his birthday I am doing a surprise breakfast party including some of his favorite treats.  Rashers are hard to find in the US even though I live in a larger city with multiple European markets none had these.<br /><br />I ordered these on a Thursday and got them Wednesday the next week.  All the dry ice was gone but they were still cold but not frozen.  I would recommend ordering them on a Monday but they were still good!<br /><br />The meat is awesome.  I would say each package would comfortably feed 2-3 people (2 would be best  They are delicious!  Fry them in a pan until browned but not crispy all over like US bacon.  Also since the shipping is the pricey part I would recommend ordering as many as you can afford at one time and freezing them.  The shipping doesn't increase significantly for multiple packages.  I bought 5 on my first order.

When I reviewed possible sellers and saw this price I thought this must be for a case of the product based on the price. When I was unable to find any quantity in the description, I assumed (I understand I take some responsibility) based on the noted ($0.06 / oz) beside the price after a little basic math I would receive approximately 360 ounces. Instead I received one 17 ounce bottle!! Again using my basic math skills, I was able to calculate the approximate per ounce value to be closer to $1.27/oz. a far cry from the .06/oz noted in the description. Of course based on the ""list price"" of $58.52 it would be $3.44/oz (thankfully i did not pay list). I have learned a lesson to make sure I verify the actual quantity. Thankfully this was not a terribly expensive lesson and makes me smile as I eat my chicken wing knowing the sauce cost more than then chicken I'm putting it on.

Ok, not the safest while walking, but when you are rushing out the door to play, or work, and baby hasn't eaten, it saves you about 20 minutes, and he loves it. He feels like such a big boy feeding himself, and I am happy too, he's eating a healthy breakfast.  If the sold the plum organics ones on here in bulk like this I'd be all over them.<br />These ones are actually meant for any age, just like apple sauce in a pouch, so my toddler can eat them too.  Yes!!!!!"
3177,B002C0Z5P6,A29G6RBW9LQQSJ,M. Bazarian,5,"We are addicted to these and always have a stash in the house. This (and other flavors) have become our go-to snack. I like them because both my four year old and 16 month old can feed themselves without the mess, so it's perfect for when we are out or on travel. In addition, all this is is pureed fruit - no added sugars, no preservatives, nothing. It's a snack I am happy to give to my kids. We take them everywhere - in the car, to the beach, to the zoo, sometimes I pack them in my son's lunch for school, etc. And they're a great snack for the parents as well... We will continue to purchase these for years I am sure."

I was hoping for a good, healthy snack and while it would be perfect for me health wise, I was hoping for something a little thicker, like applesauce!  My kids are eating them up, though."

He can open them by himself (he's 5) and they taste really good. Says on the box they can be frozen to make a kind of slushy. So that's double duty as it will keep his lunchbox cool as well.

I like that it is organic, and that there isn't a lot of extra stuff.  It's just mashed up fruits in a really handy container.  Great for keeping in your purse for when you are on the go.<br /><br />This same company makes a fruit and veggie mash-up too.  It is a genius way to sneak some vegetables into a picky 2-year-old's diet.<br /><br />For the fruit-only variety, this one (tropical) is the favorite of both my little ones. Although I should note that they have liked every single flavor.  This is just the flavor they reach for most often.<br /><br />These are expensive, that is the downside.

It is the only food she has tried so far that she refuses to eat every time I offer it. She eats green vegetables just fine but for some reason she hates these.

I think they would be fine and seem like a nice gluten free snack but according to my son's taste buds they don't particularly go well with him.

I finally was able to start her with these puffs by cutting them in 3 and then 2 pieces and giving her the whole one. She eats everything now but these puffs really helped at the beginning. She learned to pick them up, put them in her mouth and dissolve them. The great thing about them is that they dissolve much much faster than cheerios or any other puffs I tried before."

I do notice she's a little gassy after a cup full - the Kale I hear can cause that...nothing to cause alarm just something I noticed. All in all a different healthy snack."

This conditioner is smooth and goes on easily and best of all, you don't have use a whole handful It smells great and even after blow drying left my hair soft and silky, but not greasy.  I did use it with the Clear shampoo, so I think that using both products together also helped and would recommend that you get the shampoo as well!<br /><br />Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn't get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box."

It's been conditioning it, but not quite as well as expected. Her hair does look good, and it's been easy to comb through. It's still prone to some frizzing even after a week of using it following the instructions every day. It doesn't seem to be causing a build up on her hair and I do like that.<br /><br />She loves it, she likes the scent, the shape of the bottle, and how shiny her hair looks.

Immediately after drying my hair, it felt even drier than before I shampooed and conditioned. Within two days I had to wash my hair again, as it was bone dry.<br /><br />I decided to give the conditioner another try, this time as a deep conditioner along with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9G0"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce</a>.  There was some improvement in the overall moisture levels of my hair, but not enough to warrant changing from my routine of cholesterol and coconut oil conditioners.  Within days my hair was dry and brittle.  (Other than the hair dryer, I do not use any heated appliances on my hair.)<br /><br />I tried the conditioner once more as directed with the same results as before.<br /><br />Because of the increased need to shampoo, condition, and dry my hair, I feel like I experienced more breakage than I normally would have under my normal routine."

When I bagan to pour out the conditioner, I instantly noticed how watery it was. As I applied it to my hair, it was just like putting water on it, it was runny and gave no slip as I tried to detangle my hair. Honestly, this is a cheap ineffective conditioner. There are more synthetics inside of this product than shea butter which is far down on the list of ingredients. You would do much better buying some V05 conditioner for $1. If you're looking for a hydrating conditioner that gives good slip for natural hair, try Herbal Essences Hello Hydration. It has silicones just like this one but provides much better results. After using both the shampoo and conditioner, I was left with lifeless, dull hair with a waxy film over it."

I have long, very thick hair, and cheap conditioners tend to cause a lot of quick buildup; this was no exception. I could still feel the waxiness by the next time I washed my hair. Give this one a pass - use a real shea butter product instead, and it should absorb into the hair and scalp better."

Alcohol is too drying for my thin and super curly hair. I tried it out, anyway and found that is seemed to strip out some possible oil buildup I had from using natural products (including real shea butter).<br /><br />Update:<br />Had to downgrade my reviews for this line when the skin on my arms and neck started breaking out after accumulated exposure-washing my daughter's hair in the sink in addition to using other products from same line on myself that day. Not the best choice for sensitive skin.<br /><br />*Found a ""silver lining:""<br /><br />When scalp became extremely dry as a result, with dandruff ""raining down"" to the touch, I did an internet search.

While it took a moment for me to grasp where to open the bottle, it does make sense because one can get to use every last drop in the container. I would have given it five stars but the claim that it nourishes the hair and scalp disturbed me a bit because we all know that hair really cannot be nourished (this is factual). It did a fine job of conditioning my hair and I rubbed it into my scalp before rinsing it off. I would buy it!"

The Texas heat has arrived 2 months early making this selection worth a try so I can avoid 5 months of frizzies. I'm no stranger to using conditioners containing almond and coconut oils, shea butter etc. with positive results. I expected this product to perform well and it exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Clear Scalp and Hair eradicated scalp itching such that I could even skip a day between shampoos without ""cooties"". This is not the case with some other product lines. This conditioner DOES coat the hair and I needed to figure out how much rinsing I needed to get my hair to feel ""squeaky clean"". More than usual, so I'm still experimenting. The product made my hair soft, smooth, and silky just not as shiny. A shine serum was necessary.<br /><br />I vary the amount of product and rinsing BOTH for the ""squeaky clean"" feel and diluting the lingering ""tropical"" fragrance. Right now I use from dime size to quarter size dollops based on the condition of my hair when shampooing daily or every other day, or having wash-n-wear hair styles vs using hot-tooled styles.<br /><br />Overall, I do like the product and even purchased the accompanying oil and balm to incorporate into my hair care routine for the summer AND winter when dry hair and breakage is even more an issue due to dry-heated air.<br /><br />I really would like to have further directions from Unilever IF this same conditioner can be used as:<br /> o a deep conditioner, by leaving it in for X minutes before rinsing.<br /> o a curl reviving mist, by diluting it with x parts water.<br /><br />This is Step2: Smooth ...in the Ultra Shea line"

I don't use hair conditioner very often because it weighs down my hair, but I thought I would be fair and give this product a try.<br /><br />At first, the smell of the product coming through the bottle was strong and overly sweet. What surprised me was that it actually has a pleasant, not overpowering smell once you squeeze it out of the bottle.<br /><br />As for the cons, the texture is thick and feels like heavy lotion. This worried me, because as I mentioned before, certain conditioners weigh my hair down. I used a dime sized amount and coated the top and bottom parts of my hair with the product, then rinsed thoroughly. However, when I tried to dry my hair, I realized it still felt heavy with conditioner. I had to rinse for a few more minutes before I could try to dry and style again. A week later, I tried again, unfortunately to the same results.<br /><br />I can see how this can benefit other users. This conditioner, however, is definitely not for me."
3237,B007RTR9E2,A1HRYC60VTMYC0,Ace,4,"However, the bottle was designed to stand on its cap. Not a great idea, IMHO, for a container that contains a liquid. It was also shipped to me in a padded envelope, instead of a box that should have said ""This End up"" -- it leaked into the envelope -- luckily the bottle was wrapped in a plastic bag, so damage and loss were minimal.<br /><br />And the fragrance, IMHO, is a bit over-powering -- use less in the formula and I think that will help a great deal. Early morning is not the greatest time to assail my olfactory senses.<br /><br />The product itself, containing ""a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils, including vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm"", is certainly impressive, and those oils are an incredible arsenal for moisturizing and conditioning -- and ""CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner"" does condition very well. My hair is soft, shiny and feels like silk. Since I also use ""CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo"". I think the two products work together very synergystically.<br /><br />So yes I like ""CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner"" and would recommend it to others- but tweaking the design of the bottle and using a bit less of the fragrance would make this product much more enjoyable to use."
3238,B007RTR9E2,AOGN1F0Q3HW86,Glacier Mom,2,"I wanted to title my review ""happy hair"" because my 9-year-old loves this conditioner.  My medium-thick long hair could take it or leave it, but counter to my expectations, her baby-fine hair became extra gleamy and managable.  She says it gives her ""happy hair.""<br /><br />The problem, once I started looking at the ingredients, is that it's chock full of synthetics and silicones, which, oddly enough, can be skin irritants and possibly cause dermatitis in some people.  I'm not so sure that this is what you call ""nourishing the scalp""; it's more of a situation in which you apply silicone to the hair shaft to make it shiny.  So, I'm referring to the cyclopentasiloxane, stearamdo propyl dimethylamine, dimethiconol, etc.  It's a long way down the list before you get to the nourishing shea butter and coconut oil.<br /><br />I guess if I want to nourish my scalp, I could always use pure coconut oil, then shampoo it out.  For what it's worth, I try to keep ingredients natural with my kids."
3239,B007RTR9E2,A1QBOC76MIOJYP,MyPenName,2,"I have tried a few different Clear shampoos and conditioners and so far, I have not liked any of them particularly well. This one is no different.<br /><br />While the scent is nice - it smells like shea butter of course - it just doesn't perform well for me. I need to use a whole lot of it to get any kind of good detangling and softening/conditioning. After I shampoo, I add conditioner, comb it through with a wide tooth comb and then put my hair up in a clip with the conditioner still in my hair, while I wash my body. So, conditioner always sits in my hair for a good 5 minutes or so. With this conditioner, I felt like I had to use so many heaping piles of it to get just a tad bit of detangling action. Once I rinse it out, it almost feels like I never even used conditioner. Most of the time I use my other conditioner (Infusium23 or Redken Extreme) after rinsing this Clear one out. If not, I use a leave in because my hair just doesn't feel moisturized or soft enough after using the Clear. My hair is not particularly rough or damaged, so I shouldn't really need to use so much. I definitely don't need to use as much when using my regular brands.<br /><br />It does smell good and rinse well, but there are no benefits to using it. It also does not seem to coat or weigh my hair down, but again no other benefits. I need a conditioner to help me detangle and soften my hair - things a conditioner typically does - this one just doesn't do any of that for me."
3240,B007RTR9E2,A22S7D0LP8GRDH,"Jacob Hantla ""hantla.com""",3,"I used this conditioner along with the matching shampoo<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9FQ"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>for a 2-week period in order to give it time to ""work"". It is a light conditioner (feels more like lotion), and leaves my hair feeling heavy and drab. I am giving it 3 stars because I think it has potential of working on a different kind of hair (I have very fine, straight hair), and it has a non-offensive scent."
3241,B007RTR9E2,A2UM324B00HBC8,"CLR ""Celestial""",4,"This Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty/Therapy conditioner is very good. I have also tried other Clear conditioners and prefer the Total Care and Strong Lengths. They leave my hair both more manageable and shinier than the Ultra Shea does. However, this is a good conditioner, just not my first choice. My hair is fine, thin, dry, and flyaway so if yours is thick, coarse, or oily you may have an entirely different experience."

Just last month I switched to three products:<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner,<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil,<br /><br />My hair is dryer now that I am older and the shampoo really does the trick of cleaning without destroying my hair, it cleanses completely to remove product build-up. The conditioner allows me to much more easily run a brush through my hair. Without flattening my hair it reduces the dryness that flat ironing can do and reduces breakage.  It really does lock in moisture and provide long lasting nourishment.  The Therapy works best on wet hair, it gives deep, non-greasy nourishment to my hair and lends a healthy looking shine.  I can wash, condition and therapy my hair Monday. Tuesday I can wet my hair put the therapy in and it looks brand new.<br /><br />The real test was going to my salon and my stylist of 8 years noticed the difference in softness. I love the blend of shea, vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm. It really works for me. I did find the right foundation for strong, beautiful hair.<br /><br />KEEPER!"
3243,B007RTR9E2,A30ELDPP5TCQ8J,Bernard Farrell,5,"My wife has been using this for a couple weeks now and loves everything about it.  It smells great, but not overpowering, and requires only a small amount to leave her smooth and feeling good.<br /><br />The cap popped off during shipping, but it was enclosed in a tight plastic bag so only a tiny bit was lost.  However, it did bring our attention to the fact that the cap (which is on the bottom of the container) takes relatively little pressure to come off.  Might not want to travel with this in your suitcase."
3244,B007RTR9E2,A37RIRXE3WECZ,April Blake,5,"This conditioner is working great for my hair in the hot, hazy, humid days of summer.  I use it in conjunction with the Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, and it leaves my hair feeling balanced.  The conditioner has a slippery texture that helps keep my hair from tangling, and although it rinses out easily, some days, I comb the conditioner through my hair after shampooing, and then just wrap a towel around my head to get the worst of the water out, and then wind it into a bun with this conditioner still in it.  It's really helped my hair feel smooth and healthy instead of dry on the days I do actually rinse the conditioner out and do something with my hair besides a bun.  The scent, although difficult to place exactly what it is, is a clean, pleasant smell.  So far, I'm really happy with how this conditioner and its companion shampoo are working with my hair!"
3245,B007RTR9E2,AB0TLNLNOAGY4,"Shanshad ""shanachie_shadowfax""",3,"I got to admit, after liking the Ultra Shea Shampoo, I hoped to like the conditioner as well.  The packaging is nice--especially with the reversed spout to keep from confusing the shampoo and conditioner in the shower.  The product itself?  Not bad.  It's certainly not as gloppy or watery as some of the really cheap conditioners I've used.<br /><br />Let's be honest I'm a practical mommy that yanks her hair back in a pony tail and doesn't really have money to splurge on high end stuff.  For the price and the results, this is certainly well within range for a decent conditioner.  It won't hold a candle to anything really high end, granted, but at that price point, comparable high quality would be unreasonable to expect.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have with this product is one that plagues me with most conditioners.  I have a lot of hair.  In order to use enough conditioner, I have to use twice as much of it as I do the shampoo--which means it won't last nearly as long. Still, it's a useful conditioner and I like the look, feel and scent of it and would be likely to buy a bottle now and then.<br /><br />^_^ Shanshad"
3246,B007RTR9E2,A2OW356OMJNAVH,BMAR,3,"This a an effective moisturizer that left my natural African-American hair moisturized with a light scent without being uneven or leaving my hair feeling ""tacky"".  The scent is a light non-floral scent that I associate with shea butter or a light almost coconut scent.  This moisturizer worked well, but is a bit pricey relative to others that I use with a similar moisturizing ability."
3247,B007RTR9E2,ANVPLS56WCKL2,"K. Sandberg ""JaxBeach""",3,I am not really impressed with this conditioner at all. Like everyone mentions it comes out like lotion and it seems to take more of it to cover my long hair. As far as the scent goes it is reminicent of cocoa butter but I like that smell. Over all it didn't out perform my Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Conditioner which I just adore! The product is definitely over priced compared to cheaper conditioners that work a lot better. Would not recommend.
3248,B007RTR9E2,A1DC1O4VX6AHPP,"E. A. Jones ""movie buff""",4,"I was very much looking forward to the Clear Scalp & Hair product line, because using dandruff shampoo for dry scalp, as I have been doing for years, really dries out my hair.  I got both this conditioner and a shampoo, and was mostly pleased with the results.  The scent was nice, and the conditioner strong enough you didn't have to use very much of it.  The conditioner rarely gets on my scalp, though; it's mostly on my ends.  Because of this, I'm not sure it helped with my scalp at all. When the shampoo didn't control the itching as well as I would like (see separate review), I went back to dandruff shampoo brand dry scalp treatment, but this conditioner helped keep it from being so rough on my hair.  All in all, I would definitely use this conditioner again."
3249,B007RTR9E2,A2MA4ATED1B1GB,"LLM ""dagoodnurse""",4,"I liked the product, but I took 1 star off for the packaging. I lost a good bit of it because the top opened in my bag and spilled out. However, I did like the conditioner. It had a pleasant smell, and it was easy to rinse out. After I  dried my hair, my hair was nice and soft, with no tangles. I frequently get spit ends, often have to have my hairdresser trim them, but once my hair was dry I  didn't notice any. If they rework the packaging, I  will definately get more of this."

My hair is stronger and is so soft. I color and relax my hair and since using the breakage is healing and my hair is increasingly sheeding less. I use the damage and color repair along with the ultra shea products and I am sold out for this product!!! Try it you won't regret it. It really does what it says it will do!!!
3251,B007RTR9E2,A3MEMX0XF00TBD,delicateflower152,3,"After only a few uses, ""Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner"" left my hair feeling waxy and weighed down.  That was disappointing because while my hair was wet, it was slick and smooth.  Further, while blow-drying and using a round brush, I found the brush moved easily, without tangling or catching, through my wet hair.<br /><br /> ""Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner"" did not prevent my hair from ""frizzing"" as humidity increased.  Instead of the sleek look I usually achieve with my regular conditioner, I ended up with a great number off fly-away hairs.  Frizz is not a look I am trying to achieve.<br /><br />""Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner"" is packaged in a uniquely shaped container.  It fits nicely in one's hand; is easy to hold, even with wet hands; and is easy to control with respect to dispensing the shampoo.  I plan on saving the container and refilling when the ""Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner"" is gone.<br /><br />A word of warning:  ""Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner"" left the tile shower floor extremely slick and slippery.  If you use this product, please be careful that you do not fall because your shower floor is slippery.<br /><br />""Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner"" is similar to many commercially available conditioners.  It does the job, but leaves one's hair weighed down after several uses; conditioners that rinse out cleanly and completely are preferable.  I am rating ""Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner"" as a 3-star product."
3252,B007RTR9E2,A31DVKL8JE4XAH,Suzy K.,5,"Thick and rich, I like this conditioner. My very long hair was easier to comb out while it was wet, and gets less tangled when it's dry. I haven't noticed that it's any softer, but, then again, I've only used it once. One big pro is that there is no dye in this conditioner. And I love the flip cap! Press to open. Press to close. So easy!<br /><br />I always put conditioner only on the bottom 2/3 of my hair because I've been told that conditioner will weigh down the hair if it's put on the scalp. Since Unilever is saying that these Clear conditioners nourish the scalp, I've been massaging conditioner (all of the different kinds that I use) into my scalp. Not only does it not weigh my hair down, but I find that the hair near my scalp looks so much nicer, and stays cleaner longer. Just that alone is worth having tried the Clear line of products.<br /><br />Amazon has addressed the problem of leakage during shipping by putting a piece of clear tape over the lid. It worked, and the tape came off with no sticky residue left behind. Thanks, Amazon!"

It left my hair feeling silky and smooth. I used it every day, and it never felt like it was too much. It rinsed out easily, but the moisture remained. I highly recommend this product!"

I left it on for over 4 hours, but it really did soften and silken my hair and I love the way it smells. It works great in conjunction with the Clear Shampoo, but overall, I would use the conditioner and leave it on for a long time.

I need not love the smell at first as it spilled in the plastic it was wrapped in, but I liked it better after smelling on my hair. I have thick semi-long hair, and I felt it did as good a job at conditioning it as any other comparable condition for this price range ( like Pantene). I did not think it was the best conditioner I have ever used, and the smell was not pleasant enough I would go searching this out on my own. Not bad, though I would balk at paying almost five dollars for this in the store or on Amazon."

Boy, was I surprised! This has a VERY strong, perfume-y smell that I just can't get past...COMPLETELY different than the shampoo. As with the shampoo, it does it's job just fine: detangling and conditioning, and my hair does feel quite silky (as much a very short bob can) after it's dry. That part I like. It rinses well, so hair doesn't feel gummy or sticky. The product appears to have a silicone derrivative in in, so if you're trying to avoid that (ie: fine hair or volume style, this product may not be for you.

I had to use a leave-in to achieve the desired results. I was also a little disappointed in the scent. It didn't have the wow factor of the other conditioners and seemed bland.

Then, sadly, my issues would pop up again.<br /><br />When I first saw the commerical for Clean, I knew that it may be different than all the other products I have tried before. Claiming to work at the scalp then down the hair instead of the other way around. Upon first use, I noticed how light the product was. It didn't feel heavy or feel like it was still in my hair after rinsing. Clean promises to change your hair after 7 days. Mine took two. The first day, I noticed how much softer my hair was. By the second, my flakes were all but gone. I use this product every day and I am still amazed with the results. Something that I have been battling for so long to be gone like that. Clean is a product that I have been recommending to all my friends and family. And I could not be happier with it."

The price also seems very reasonable.
3272,B007RTR9E2,AID96A35CQO18,Stephanie,3,"I use only conditioner on my hair and avoid styling at least 2 days a week. I'm trying to strengthen my damaged hair. The CLEAR Ultra Shea conditioner appealed to me because of the use of natural oils like coconut and almond, so I wanted to try it.<br /><br />First of all, the conditioner leaked in shipping. The bottle was inside a bubble mailer, wrapped in a bag, so that the mess was contained, but this pointed out a design flaw. The bottle is cool-looking in shape and color, but the dispenser is on the bottom. Many conditioners are designed like this (with a flip lid cap), but CLEAR has a push-type opener. Obviously, shipping this product is cause for disaster. A flip lid would take some effort to open, but the push lid...well, a bump or two in transit will result in conditioner all over the packaging - and you're also out a good amount of product!<br /><br />So, this product may not be conducive to mail-order, unless Amazon packages in a more secure matter.<br /><br />As for the conditioner itself: Whew! I smelled it right away, since it had leaked! And it smelled a bit overpowering at first. I don't like strong-smelling styling products, so I was nervous when I went to use it the first time. However, the smell is actually quite soft and pleasant. Not overly flowery or fruity, just clean and nice.<br /><br />I was surprised that CLEAR's Ultra Shea conditioner was not as greasy as many conditioners that I have used in the past. It easily coated my hair from root to tip, but was just as easy to rinse out. I felt no residue or heaviness on my hair afterwards. My hair felt soft.<br /><br />As for the claims of all the wonderful oils in the product: well, yes, they're there. But beware - the conditioner is not quite a 'natural' as the description makes it sound. Lots of chemical ingredients are listed before the good stuff. I've been making the transition to more natural products in our food, but haven't quite changed in my beauty products, yet. So this doesn't bother me too much, except for CLEAR making it sound more natural than it really is."

I have thick, long, dry hair and I was able to comb this conditioner through my hair with no problems. It takes a little longer to rinse out that some other brands but it worked well and would recommend it. My hair is soft and I have had very few tangles since using it. The bottle has a flip top opening at the bottom which makes it easier for the product to come out."

""Roundtable Reviews""",5,"I did start by using the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Shampoo, so this review is based on using both products together.<br /><br />I have relatively long, very thick, and very wavy hair. Frizzing is a major problem, especially in humidity, which Vermont often experiences during the rainy spring weather. I also color my hair, so it can dry out. My hair stylist swears by the Redken line for dry hair, but I've tried it and have never been impressed. I'm sick of paying $15 to $30 for shampoo and conditioners that do not work.<br /><br />Clear's Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish impressed me. I started with the shampoo and then moved on to the conditioner. Applied it to all the hair, making sure the ends got extra attention, waited two minutes, and then rinsed. I moved on to blow drying it partially and was amazed with the results. My hair came out shiny, feeling like silk, and best of all, even on a very rainy day, there was no frizz.<br /><br />It smells a little like a Pina Colada, but stronger on the coconut side. I love that smell, my husband and daughter hate it. Given that, it wasn't so strong that they couldn't tolerate being near me. If you dislike the smell of coconut, you may not enjoy this line as much as I do.<br /><br />Based on my use of this new shampoo and conditioner line, however, I've found a new favorite shampoo and conditioner line. With Sunday papers offering up lots of $2 off coupons on this new line, I'm going to be stocking up."

I have been using salon shampoos and conditioners on my hair for ages now, and been really displeased with how my hair has been looking. It's grey, very thick and wiry, and was dry and brittle to the touch, and had totally lost its sheen. One wash with Clear Ultra Shea has changed all that. My hair hasn't felt this soft in years, and it's actually shining!<br /><br />Clear Ultra Shea smooth and Nourish Conditioner has a lovely feel to it. The aroma is very subtle and quite pleasant, and I like the packaging a lot. The cylinders are sturdy, with tops that press open easily, and the shampoo stands on its feet, and conditioner on its head, so there is no confusion as to what bottle you're reaching for, half blind with no glasses on and water running down your face. I'm going to keep using Clear Ultra Shea, and those salon products will have to go bye bye."

I was at first perplexed at the idea of massaging conditioner into my scalp, but I obeyed the instruction. My roots look great and my scalp feels great.  The conditioner has a good, thick consistency, allowing for a little to go a long way.  The smell is wonderful.  I believe this could be used as regular as any other conditioner or, like me, to boost everything now and then."

I gave it a try and oh I should mention; I have super sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it. I used it with the matching conditioner and together they made my hair feel really soft and like I said not irritated which is a huge thing for me. I have to be very careful what products I use and the scent is pleasant. Not too powerful.

I use tar shampoo (Neutrogena T-Gel and the store brand of it) and Tea Tree Oil which smells like bug spray.  Those shampoos require me to use conditioner because of how drying they are.  This conditioner is the only one I've seen that has a good amount of moisture but not too much for hair that is oily and also is good for scalp problems.  By the way, it covers the stinky shampoo's smells, too!"

I have thick, sometimes frizzy hair when it gets hot and humid, and this stuff makes my hair smoother and a little less full-looking, which is what I want. It contains a great shea butter smell that makes me feel like I'm vacationing somewhere exotic.<br /><br />My wife, on the other hand, isn't as keen on this conditioner as me. She feels it leaves a residue that feels heavy and is hard to get out of your hair. To me, the sign of good conditioner is the kind that is hard to get out of your hair with water, but she doesn't like that. Her rating for this product was three stars.<br /><br />The bottle is long and slender and has a convenient pop-up cap that's easy to open and close. I like how the cap end of the bottle is the flat portion that you place down; all the shampoo in the bottle builds toward that end, so you'll never have to hit the back of the bottle to squeeze shampoo out."

3281,B007RTR9E2,APCSV85SWASN2,Word Lover,3,"The scent of Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner is intensely coconut-y, with a hint of almond. One whiff and you're mentally transported to the Caribbean. This may not appeal to all users, but I loved it. The price for a 12.7 ounce plastic bottle is econommical and the  bottle design is streamlined, attractive and stable.<br /><br />After using this creamhy product, my long, curly hair was easy to comb and style. My scalp had been feeling dry and itchy, and true to its promise, this conditioner offered relief on that count. So far, so good. My hair, however, looked a bit duller and not as soft as expected, which was a disappointment. My advice is to be sparing with this conditioner when you apply and wash it out very well."
3282,B007RTR9E2,A2W2E6BPPYZO0T,YA book lover,3,"My main problem with this line of products is how thick both shampoos and conditioners are, to the extent that it's hard to squeeze them out of the bottle. As for other qualities, it's just ok for my hair. This conditioner just doesn't detangle my hair, which is supposed to be one of the primary purposes of a conditioner."
3283,B007RTR9E2,AN0U0GNJJPEUR,N. Rogers,4,"The first thing I noticed is that it smells quite a bit like suntan lotion.  Thankfully the smell went away as soon as I rinsed my hair.  This is a fairly thick conditioner, but it didn't weigh down my hair (which is shoulder-length and color-treated).  In all, there doesn't seem to be much of a difference between this conditioner and others that I've tried.  Considering that Clear is an inexpensive line, this one will do just as well for me.  I don't really like that it opens on the bottom though."

After shampooing my hair was hard, tangled, and dry feelong. Then I thought maybe the conditioner will help my hair so I put the conditioner in and it did NOTHING, my hair was so tangled, no kind of moisture what so ever to it, my hair was extremely dry and tangled and was very hard to detangle even after applying the conditioner. So I ended up rewashing my hair that same day with Garnier Triple Nutrition which I LOVE LOVE LOVE and would recommend to anyone! I will never ever ever buy this Clear Ultra Shea or recommend to anybody you would be better off buying some Suave shampoo and conditioner than this mess. I am very upset that I have two almost full bottles of this shampoo and conditioner that's going in the trash unless I find somebody that likes it that I know."

I wouldn't say I have dandruff every day, but I *can* have some if I end up itchy right before I wash my hair.<br /><br />I really did itch less with this conditioner. In fact, I've been trying all sorts of conditioners since I ran out of this, and I also went back to my old conditioner, but nothing has worked to both moisturize my hair and calm that ""need to wash my hair"" scalp itch. I thought it would end up drying my hair out further, but I used it about a month, and that didn't happen. So, I'm sold on it, and if you have some scalp itch, I think it's worth trying out."

My hair and head feel utterly clean after using it. I work in a restaurant, and some days come home sweating and gross, so I need something that'll be like an industrial cleaner on my head. This stuff does that well. My hair always feels squeaky clean. However, I find that if I don't follow up immediately with a deep conditioner, my hair tends to feel rather light and dry. That's great if you have fine hair that needs that lift. When you have thick hair, it turns into a giant 'fro, and is not cute. The smell is nice, and not too strong.

My biggest complaint about this particular product is the scent. I'm not sure how to explain it, but the scent seems a little chemical to me. It reminds me of a very faint version of the way your hair smells after a perm.<br /><br />This product isn't so bad that I won't eventually finish the bottle, but it's not something I plan on purchasing in the future."

Her hair is much coarser than mine, naturally curly, straightened, blow dried, often frizzy and a different color just about every week.  Straight off the plane her hair looked about like so much straw on her head, badly in need of some intensive repair.<br /><br />The difference in her hair was striking, right from the very first use - soft, smooth, no frizz.  Even her drastically split ends were nowhere near as apparent.  Needless to say, she raved about this conditioner - so much so that I'm going to have to order a year's supply to drag across the pond to the UK when I go to visit this fall.<br /><br />Give this a try for your problem hair."

Like the other ones I've tried, this one is lightly scented and the scent is not too bad, but I prefer the scents of the non-shea conditoners they have.  The consistency of the conditioner is okay but I prefer thicker conditioners. It rinses out well enough and leaves my hair soft.<br />I like that the spout is on the bottom because this helps the conditioner settle and makes it easier to get the last bit of conditioner out of the bottle."

As a result, and with apology, my reviews for these products will be very similar.<br /><br />The scent of the conditioner is fine (it smells like the shampoo).  It's neither particularly outstanding nor is it bad.  The scent, such as it is, is not very long lasting.  I did find that the conditioner wasn't quite as ""weightless"" as I expected.  It seemed to take a bit longer than normal to get all the conditioner out of my hair.<br /><br />After using it, I didn't notice any particular change in my hair.  It didn't seem stronger or shinier.

It does a good job of moisturizing my hair without leaving a oily or waxy feeling. So it is a good conditioner but I have one problem with it. It has a very different smell to it that I don't care for. It smells like clay or play-doh to me and I just don't like it.

I got this Clear Scalp with the matching shampoo, and am quite happy with it.  My hair ends up totally soft and totally tangle free.  That's all I ask from a conditioner.  Oh, it also can't have a heavy perfume smell, because that gives me headaches.  This one has a slight perfume scent, and it doesn't linger, so that works."
3296,B007RTR9E2,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,James Morris,5,"I got ULTRA SHEA SMOOTH & NOURISH CONDITIONER mainly for my roommate, who complained to me recently that he has tried many, many conditioners and found that they either dry out his hair or dry out his scalp, or both.  He also mentioned that many products he'd tried did not result in the manageability he had purchased the product for in the first place.  So, when Amazon offered this product, I decided to try it for our bathroom.<br /><br />Fortunately for me, I do not have the type of hair that really needs a conditioner.  My hair is normally soft and manageable, no matter what the weather or how often I wash it, which is usually daily.  Still, I do like to use a conditioner every ten days or so, just to keep my hair feeling the way I like it.<br /><br />Well, ULTRA SHEA SMOOTH & NOURISH CONDITIONER more than met both of our expectations.  My roommate is a professional actor, who needs to have a consistent appearance and wants to make sure he looks exactly the same day after day, especially when making a film or doing a long stretch in a theatre piece.  I asked him what he thought about this conditioner, and he said that it was probably the best he'd ever tried.  Especially important was the fact that it did not dry out his hair or scalp, but he mentioned that he also liked the way it made his hair feel, even when using it on a daily basis.  As for me, I have no complaint at all; the odor is agreeable and it leaves my hair feeling even more silky than usual.  As far as I'm concerned, it's a perfect conditioner, and we will continue to use it.<br /><br />Highly recommended."

I decided to give it a day in between washes to see how this product would hold up, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't need it daily after all!  My hair was still nice and fresh on that in between day.  I think I will continue using this conditioner on a regular basis now.<br /><br />I love the smell, too!  It smells so good.  Not overpoweringly so, either.  The container is essentially upside down, with the lid on the bottom.  I really liked this because I feel I'm getting every last drop out of it.<br /><br />It moisturizes well and my usually hard to comb wet hair combed nice and smoothly.  I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great product at a decent price."

In fact, I noticed a difference after just one use-and not in a good way.<br /><br />This product however was much better.  The conditioner helped restore the moisture that the Clear Scalp & Hair Moisture shampoo had striped away.  I also used the Clear Scalp & Hair Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil which added a lot of shine.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone with long hair (long hair is old hair-the closer to the scalp the younger the hair), curly hair or thick & coarse hair because the shea butter adds the moisture that your hair needs but it doesn't make your hair greasy or weighed down.  If you have thin or fine hair I would try a volumizing formula instead."

When using various shampoo with it, this conditioner left the hair beautifully shiny, soft, and very curly and wavy.  The color was enhanced nicely too.<br /><br />So, despite having a not to impressed outlook, this conditioner turned out to be a fantastic find and I know at least one person in our household will be using it until it is gone and most likely repurchasing too!<br /><br />We also like the way the container is made.  It stands up straight, does not leak, and dispenses the conditioner just right.  The scent is fresh and fruity/herbal very reminiscent of a high end brand which works well too."

If I use it daily it makes my hair to oily, but on the other schedule it leaves it soft and feeling moisturized.  It rinses well and also doesn't weigh my hair down, which is good for my naturally curly hair.  Additionally I have had less problem with frizziness which is great here in the Northwest. One last note is I do like the smell of it; although because it rinses well it doesn't linger as much on my hair as I would like.<br /><br />Overall for the price I am happy with this conditioner and will continue to use it in a rotation with other conditioners that work well for my hair."

I have curly hair which needs hydration so I thought this would work, but it made my curls just drag.

So I'm used to about 4 days of good hair and then 4 days of fighting with it until I wash it again.<br /><br />That's not a problem with this conditioner. It leaves my hair really soft (which also makes it easier to straighten) and my hair is shiny and healthy and bouncy until I wash it again. I'm really excited to have found this line. The shampoo that goes along with this is also a great product.<br /><br />Note: I would say this is probably just for really dry hair, though the shampoo can be used on anyone with dandruff or a problem with excess oil or product buildup on the scalp.

And on top of that it really moisturized my hair wonderfully!  I used a medium/small blob and worked it thoroughly through my hair after shampooing.  It rinsed out well and left a soft, protective coating that really made my hair shine and feel very healthy and soft.

Isn't that what we're all looking for? So far, after a few uses, this product has done well. It it thick so you know you're not putting a handful of just water on your hair. It rinses off and feels clean and has a pleasant smell.<br /><br />My hair has some 'fluff' factor without a lot of flyaways and feels nice to run my hands through it.<br /><br />It doesn't make my hair feel extraordinary but it does feel good. For the price, it's a good product."

Studer ""Terra57""",4,"After using the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Shampoo I used this to make sure I could get an accurate impression of the Shea line and I loved it.  When you put the conditioner in your hair it feels as though you are adding liquid silk.  I leave my conditioner in for 3 minutes and then rinse and my hair felt so nice and clean and silkie.  The fragrance is nice and not overpowering which is a big plus in my book.  Overall though I do like using the two products together for the perfect results.  I have dry hair so this is great.  Also this would be great to add to your hair just before leaving the beach after your hair has been beaten by the salt, sand and wind."
3315,B007RTR9E2,A1FPQ54AIB26L0,Mike Wallace,5,"This conditioner has a light scent that is not bad, but not my favorite. This conditioner seems to have extra conditioning power. It must be the shea oil. My hair came out really smooth and clean, but it felt super conditioned. I don't know if this is a product that I would use all the time, because it almost conditioned too much, for my hair. I'm also not crazy about the scent, I thought the moisturizing oil smelled much better and I was disappointed this wasn't the same. If I was in the market for a super conditioning extra moisturizer product this one would be a good choice."
3316,B007RTR9E2,A3SDXX0IE7T2BD,gorjis1,5,"The first thing I do is read the ingredients before I use a hair product, because there are often harsh chemicals included. I did not see that with this product. It is one of the best conditioners I had ever used! It was very thick, smelled great, and left my hair soft and detangled. I will definitely purchase this product."
3317,B007RTR9E2,A3FWSG0GV6FRB6,Roselynde Barrow,4,"I got this conditioner to go with the hair oil of the same line. I don't have the shampoo, so I used it with my normal Pantene Pro V. Right away I could feel the difference in the conditioner itself; it was thick and dense, but not oily or heavy on my hair. It moisturized without stripping, a major problem for me.<br /><br />It says for scalp, but I didn't see any dramatic results on my scalp. You aren't supposed to apply conditioner directly to the scalp(it can cause dandruff and other similar problems), so maybe that's why.<br /><br />But my hair has remained silky smooth for a few days now, and stayed very un-tangly! A BIG bonus. I don't brush my hair that often as it makes it frizzy as all heck, but leads to huge dread like tangles after a day or two. This conditioner has kept my hair feeling clean and smooth without any other changes in my routine."
3318,B007RTR9E2,A3094EPI56GKZ6,"Kristen E. Bogren ""Kristen Bogren""",5,"I am new to this product line- I use with the Ultra Shea Smooth Shampoo- I have very thin hair.. It smells great, does a super job conditioning my hair where it is very easy to put a comb through.. Smells great- Hair is super shiny and soft- Love this product line !"
3319,B007RTR9E2,A1VQBEW0G4IH1J,L. Knights,4,"This conditioner comes in a nice, ergonomic bottle that has the cap on the bottom - a feature I love, since the product is always easy to squeeze out even near the end of the bottle and you don't get ""ketchup syndrome"" where you are trying and trying to get it out and then too much comes out in a big blop. It would fit in my shower caddie better if it was a little shorter and squatter, but oh well.<br /><br />The smell is like something from a salon and it is very STRONG. When the bottle first arrived and I unpacked it, it was sitting near me and I had to move it because the smell was driving me nuts. Not bad smell, just strong smell. And that was before even opening it!<br /><br />I used this right after doing a color-oops treatment on my hair, trying to remove some of the henna I've applied over the years. The treatment itself isn't really damaging, but you have your hair under running water for a long time and shampoo it several times and it is extremely drying because of that. I massaged it on my scalp, although I usually am trying to NOT get conditioner on my scalp, since the directions say to do that. I can't say my scalp felt really moist afterwards or anything, but it did a good job of restoring moisture and softness to my hair. This conditioner is a little oily for me to use after every shampoo, but it was perfect after color-oops and I think would be great after hennaing my hair as well.<br /><br />Although this conditioner is called ""Ultra Shea"", there are a lot of other oils in there providing moisture, including soy and palm.<br /><br />There are some rather mysterious ingredients in this conditioner so I looked some of them up. Basically, I was wondering if it had 'cones in it (like silicone...usually anything that ends in ""cone"") and it didn't list anything ending in cone in the ingredients but I wanted to be sure. It turns out the third ingredient, cyclopentasiloxane, is a silicone. Not only does it have 'cones, it's a top ingredient! Now, some people swear by 'cones and some people swear by staying away from cones, but I just think it's good to know they're in there before you try a product as it gives you a better idea of what to expect. My experience is that 'cones work okay on my hair BUT it can cause a buildup after a while that can leave hair sort of flat and greasy. (Nothing a little clarifying can't fix...apple cider vinegar rinse or whatever.) It's also not the best thing to be using right before you do something to your hair like, say, applying color-oops or doing some kind of fancy treatment, since the 'cones tend to coat your hair and might get in the way.<br />i<br />For what it's worth, cyclopentasiloxane is one of the fancier 'cones that is likely better at what it does than some of the others. It also evaporates, so if you feel like the conditioner is still there gunking up your hair after you rinse it, it's probably the cyclopentasiloxane, and once you dry and style it all that gunk is not going to be there any more. No point in over-rinsing. My favorite conditioner has got to be Aussie 3 Minute Miracle, and this seems like it would be an okay substitute."
3320,B001EQ5DOW,A24RF77HAXIR89,"E. Roy ""motherof10""",3,"Well, I was hoping that the poultry seasoning I got would be of a newer vintage, but the code shows mine was packed in August, 2001. However, it still smells pretty potent. I'm going to actually cook with it before I send it back. Price wise, Walmart wanted $3.78  for .065 ounces...so this is a steal. I'm going to rate it middling till I actually use it. Then I'll rerate it based on flavor, not just dates.<br />On the cooking side of things, poultry seasoning is my secret ingredient in nearly all of my soups. Potato soup, cream of broccoli, chicken...all benefit greatly from 1/2- 1 tsp of poultry seasoning."

3323,B001E5E0HE,A3A90CELVLOUP6,"Nanciejeanne ""Enjay""",5,"I used to buy daiquiris and margaritas already mixed in individual freezer bags and enjoyed the convenience very much. For some reason, I cannot find these anymore.  BTW: There are some made by Daily's, but they are made with wine, not liquour (but taste really good anyway!)<br /><br />Still, I was looking for my favorite cocktails in a portable bag. These were very good! They are very fruity (with real strawberry seeds) and creamy..not like kool aid. Also, they freeze really well, no big, sharp shards of ice, but with a squeeze or two, they were more like a slushy.<br /><br />To make: You open the twist cap, fill first with rum (to a premarked line), shake to mix, then fill the rest of the way with water and freeze.<br /><br />I made the first batch just this way, by pouring the liquor right in the bag up to the ""fill line"" on the packaging. I don't know if I had the bag set on the counter incorrectly or what, but the powder seemed to absorb the liquid and I ended up pouring too much rum in the bag and hadn't even reached the line! It didn't even freeze too well as it was too strong (we did drink them anyway!) With the second bag, I measured the rum in a measuring cup (1 1/2 cups...it is written on the bag, too.) They were better. You can vary the amount of liqour to your taste (or even use different kinds of alcohol...or I suppose none at all if you want.)<br /><br />One more fun tip: I mixed the entire bag, then poured individual servings into small ziploc freezer bags. I think I used about 5 or 6 little ziplocs per 1 Lt. Blender Bag (which makes 1/2 gallon.) Then I froze all the little bags. That way we could take only 1 when we wanted it, OR we could throw a few in our beach bags and they stayed slushy for hours. Plus, we didn't have to carry much garbage when we were done (like with cans or bottles.) Also, we didn't have to worry about doling out servings into cups or anything. Just slip a straw into a little opening in the zipper and enjoy!"

Additionally, the large amount of smoked paprika in the mix gives the food a wonderful red color.<br /><br />If you have guests that like a little more heat in their food without overpowering your fish, add a couple pinches of fine - not coarse! - ground pepper to the mix.  Your taste buds will thank you!<br /><br />Interestingly enough, this mix also works well on catfish, chilean sea bass, and orange roughy.

I've had this spice for what seems like years. Recently while trying out the steak rub I remembered I had this spice rub somewhere in the kitchen cupboard. There it was a little lumpy but still very edible. I just mashed up everything with a spoon and the spice rub was good to go. So it is not only great tasting, it lasts a long time. I will say that now that I'm back to eating a lot of salmon on a diet that requires you to eat 5-7 ounces of protein a night I probably will be using this salmon rub quite a bit more often.

I believe they have different flavors, I usually stick with Honey as the standard.<br /><br />Ease of eating (important for me as a cyclist): The waffles are soft, perhaps a little bit too soft. I think if you hold it at one end, the other end will probably start to sag. But I usually don't hold it long enough before the whole thing makes it to my mouth. This is soft, so you can swallow it in a couple of bites / chews. So much better than some of the energy bars that takes forever to chew and swallow.<br /><br />Cons: The only gripe that I have is that it is crumbly.. little tiny bits will fall off the edges or linger at the edge of your mouth. The other thing is that it is soft, so don't place too much pressure on it or you'll find your waffle shaped like a fortune cookie.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is the best fuel on bike.

Honestly, I have to stop myself from eating more then 1 a day. I'm lucky to have some self control because i'd probably eat 2 or 3 a day. If i had to complain about anything is the packages don't open very easily, it causes the waffle to crumble in the package sometimes. But im just being picky here, this product is perfect."
3366,B004F1LNDI,A2N4AB5ERL59YG,Jason Giles,5,"Honey Stinger Waffles have become my go-to prerace breakfast. For a half marathon, I'll usually eat one about 2 hours before the race, another about 45 minutes before the start, and then I'm good to go.  They are tasty and very easy to digest.  The strawberry and vanilla varieties are also good, but the honey is my favorite."
3367,B004F1LNDI,ATMNAEMOE2T2S,Matt,5,I get tired of only consuming gels on long runs and these honey stingers are a delicious alternative that deliver about the same amount of energy (even without the caffeine) while also being easy on the stomach.
3368,B004F1LNDI,A2L01ZA2NNI6PH,"Roy G. Biv ""toy fan 3000""",4,"I am a fan of the Honey Stinger bars, and bought these because I needed something lighter that I could take with me on my bike rides or before a jog. Wow these are very tasty and are enough of a snack to keep me going. They are as wide as the base of a soda can, and are great on the go. I would recommend these if you like the Stinger bars."
3369,B004F1LNDI,A2BLJGGWN8GTXQ,Sean,4,"These are thin so that several can be put in a pack without taking up too much room.  The packages are about 5x4 inches and 3 or 4 packages stacked is about an inch.<br /><br />They taste good (especially when compared with some of the other endurance foods) and go down fairly easy even after 30 miles.<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, they have never given me any GI issues during a run.  Of course this can vary from person to person, but they're worth a try.<br /><br />The only reason I deducted a star is because they're a bit overpriced for what they are."
3370,B004F1LNDI,AN8YHFOK0GO8J,Ethan,4,Taste great. They are pretty small so I need at least two on my 2+ hour bike rides. A noticeable pick me up.
3371,B004F1LNDI,A1RDAFCAM562FR,Rod Auric,5,"I'm sold on the product. I use it as a part of my long distance bicycle riding nutrition for a pre ride energy bump. But really, I eat it because they are so tasty. It's a good thing they are individually packaged as there is a huge temptation to eat several at once. I buy two boxes at a time because the other riders in my house have discovered my pre-ride indulgence and I don't want to run out. (Though I suspect they pilfer a few in between rides as well!) I'll admit they are little hard to eat while pedaling (pieces tend to break off) so I've adapted to using it pre-ride or at a break stop. I give it 4 stars, not 5, only because this last batch was not quite as fresh as I've had in the past. Oh what the heck. 5 stars! I'd write more but I hear a honey waffle calling my name."
3372,B004F1LNDI,A3P6BWY1VOZ7KR,Chestoozo,4,"I'm a big fan of waffles and honey, so when Honey Stinger came up with this product I had to check it out.  The taste is delicious - sweet honey and toasted waffle goodness.  My only complaint is the portion size, which at 1oz left me craving more!<br /><br />They fit well in a jersey pocket for snacks during long rides and open fairly easily, even while riding.  All in all, I think they're a good source of energy for periodic re-fueling."
3373,B004F1LNDI,A34KO3JNKTZU6Y,G. Kauppila,5,"Tired of gels, chews, bloks, & beans?  I am.  I saw the ads for this and thought ""what next"".  Then I tried one.  Man, these are the bomb!!  They are a delicious change from all the other stuff out there.  They are dry, but easy to eat with a dry mouth. They aren't very sticky either so they are easy to eat while running.  They won't melt when kept in my hydration vest pocket or SPI Belt.  I like em when I'm dong 13+ mile runs now.  I usually eat one every 40 minutes with Honey Stinger chews in between.  They are about 170 calories, but the about 3.5gm of saturated fat.  Seems like alot for something like this."
3374,B004F1LNDI,ACDLR5R5XCDTO,Richard Fiske,5,I use this product for endurance mountain biking and training for races.  These waffles are very tasty and a nice change-up from my other on-the-bike fueling options.  The only downside is that they have more fat than I prefer but this hasn't caused any digestive issues.  Packaging is OK for eating on the fly - could be better but I've seen worse.
3375,B004F1LNDI,A1SW1OIGG8IDGE,Monica,5,These little waffles are insanely delicious.  They are just the right amount of sweet and crunchy....I would eat one every day!
3376,B004F1LNDI,A3O4SQZ6GR76LP,allstarwars,5,"I take these on All my bike rides!  Never leave home without one...or two!! And they transport extremely well in my jersey pockets.  I really prefer the Honey flavored, but will easily take Vanilla or Strawberry.  Gotta give these a try."
3377,B004F1LNDI,ARO8VT4WPWVD0,"D ""OC Paddler & Computer Geek""",5,"These are delicious and don't give me any stomach problems.  I used them a few times when training for triathlon, but mostly use them for long canoe races (outrigger canoe in open ocean) when going hard for 3-6 hours.  They have plenty of calories for how easy they are to digest.  I used to use Kit Kats and Twix, but the chocolate coating on those can make them difficult to eat when it melts, and sometimes if I ate those super fast my stomach wouldn't like it.  No stomach problems with these.  The one imperfection is that they're a bit greasy, so if you touch them they make your hands greasy and slippery.  Not good when you're paddling.  Trying to hold it by the wrapper without touching the waffle with your fingers while you're going can be slightly cumbersome, but well worth it."
3378,B004F1LNDI,A33JSYA4JMY5O1,Zachary B. Taylor,5,"I just started using these and I really like the size/shape and texture. The taste is way better than a chewy dry/dull cliffs bar. I do triathlons and will use these as my ""go-to"" snack on the go on the bike and if necessary the run. Great source of calories/carbs for during a workout or whenever.  I highly recommend considering for triathletes out there looking for something pleasant, light and not too hard on stomach during race."
3379,B004F1LNDI,A2LYSSWLGMM3A0,zizzy,3,"I put a couple of these in my backpack in place of my usual cliff bars on a 10 mile day hike this weekend.  Taste was ok (I actually like the taste of clif bars though, so consider the source), big problem was all the crumbs!  I don't know if they got smashed up in my pack or what, but on opening crumbs spilled out everywhere... and I made the mistake of opening the first one right over my pack :(.<br />I'll use the rest of them, but I don't think I'll order them again."
3380,B004F1LNDI,AD0GRFJ69TTQJ,River,5,"These are delicious for what they are!  I generally keep one or two of these in my bento box on my bike to eat on particularly long rides if I'm tired of my liquid nutrition and want something solid.  I don't depend on these for nutrition, but I like to have them there in case I bonk or just need an extra boost.<br /><br />They've also been a life-saver to tide me over post-ride or run when I'm ravenously hungry but haven't had a chance to get my pwo noms.  Who am I kidding; I've also used these post-swim after 5k swim race when I'm about to gnaw my arm off but haven't had the chance to get real food!<br /><br />I've also used these as pre-run fuel when I want some energy but don't want to eat anything big before a long run.  They're just a fun & convenient source of energy when you need something quick and easily digested.  Just enough taste/calories/nutrition, easy to digest, quick energy, convenient packaging, and easy storage.  A great food to keep around your workout gear ""just in case""."
3381,B004F1LNDI,A2E2JX9PMVB7E6,D. Garcia,5,"Love, love, love Honey Stinger waffles!  They taste great, transport well and give me a great energy boost before, during and after long runs.  I recommend them as they are easy on the stomach, not too heavy and satisfy my sweet tooth as well!"
3382,B004F1LNDI,A3743RYZ27G8X4,Shopper77,5,"I received a free sample and I was hooked on first bite. SO YUMMY. I could see eating these for regular snacks and not just as a pre-work out snack. Im a runner and I could see how these might be difficult to eat while running, but you can eat them prior to you run. If you are on the fence, try them!"
3383,B004F1LNDI,A1LRKWCVDMHQ3T,Nathan W. Hiatt,5,"Great product, nice sweet after dinner treat or trail pick me up.  Healthy and delicious!  Everyone I share one with, loves them too.  I should be getting a commission."
3384,B004F1LNDI,A2SJTSBT6D9OHG,G-Money,5,"If you're looking for a product while on the bike for fueling and have had stomach issues digesting those nasty gels, this is the product to get.  It works quite well, has no crash, and no stomach upset issues that the gels cause some people.  I love the product, the packaging is a little tricky to open while riding but you'll get the hang of it, and add these as a supplement for long distance rides.  I use these, peanut butter cracker sandwiches, and thin tortillas with PB&J inside."
3385,B004F1LNDI,A2WZMC8EGFC0XW,kaytay,5,"Can I just say that these taste awesome!!  I have not had a chance to try these during a run yet, but from the other reviews I'll probably just open the package first before I leave.  They absolutely give me a burst of energy, and taste really good.  would recommend to others!!"
3386,B004F1LNDI,A1U18N7VCMD7M9,"G. J. Bruce ""gjbruce""",5,Can you say manna from heaven. Well not really but probably close.  These do taste really good. They have a nice pick me up.  You can definately feel the difference.  I will be using these on all my bike rides.
3387,B004F1LNDI,ASF677WMR2RIX,swimbikerun1997,5,"If you have not tried these they are great.  I could eat them just for a snack.  I typically take them on long bike rides as they are much more palatable than most of the gel products and sometimes it is nice to eat something solid when training.  You can't beat the price on Amazon.  I have paid more that $1 per at specialty stores for these.<br /><br />I would not recommend these for race situations as they are simply too hard to open in my opinion.  When I try to open them while riding I either have to slow way down or stop, or else I end up with a bunch of crumples and end up dropping half the cookie."
